In actuality, says the lawsuit, the fine print of the contract offered no such guarantees.\nThe true aim of the deal was to grant American Media the rights to her story of an affair with Mr. Trump and prevent her from discussing it with news media, the lawsuit says.\nThe lawsuit asks a judge to invalidate the contract on grounds that it\u2019s both fraudulent and illegal. The complaint says the agreement amounted to an illegal corporate donation from American Media to Mr. Trump\u2019s presidential campaign, with the aim of boosting his chances in the 2016 election by helping him keep the alleged affair under wraps.\nMs. McDougal\u2019s complaint follows a lawsuit filed earlier this month by a former adult-film star, Stephanie Clifford, seeking to escape a nondisclosure agreement that prevents her from discussing an alleged sexual encounter with Mr. Trump. Mr. Trump\u2019s personal lawyer, Michael Cohen, paid Ms. Clifford $130,000 for signing the deal, the Journal revealed in January.\nThe White House has denied Ms. McDougal\u2019s story of an affair with the president, as well as Ms. Clifford\u2019s. A White House spokesman didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment.\nThe Journal previously reported that Mr. Cohen was also in communication with AMI Chief Executive David Pecker and the company\u2019s chief content officer, Dylan Howard, during the course of their negotiations with Ms. McDougal, citing a person familiar with the matter. Mr. Pecker is friends with both Mr. Cohen and Mr. Trump.\nAn American Media spokesman said Ms. McDougal\u2019s contract gave the company discretion to publish her \u201clife story, and she promised to write health and fitness columns and appear on the cover of two magazines.\u201d He said that American Media has published 20 of her columns and put her on the cover of one of its fitness magazines.\n\u201cHer lawsuit is the first time AMI has learned of her desire to go a different direction,\u201d the spokesman said. \u201cAMI has a valid contract with Karen and we look forward to reaching an amicable resolution satisfactory to her and to AMI.\u200b\u201d\u200b \u200b\nAmerican Media has previously denied the campaign-finance allegations. \u201cNeither President Trump, Mr. Cohen, nor any other individual has ever influenced (or will ever influence) coverage at AMI\u2019s publications,\u201d the company said in a statement emailed to the Journal in February.\nThe campaign-finance allegations mirror February complaints filed with the Federal Election Commission and the U.S. Department of Justice by Common Cause, a Washington, D.C., nonprofit group.\n\u201cIf AMI won\u2019t let her out of this illegitimate contract we\u2019re going to litigate,\u201d said Peter Stris, Ms. McDougal\u2019s lawyer. \u201cWe\u2019re going to litigate and prove there was coordination between American Media, Karen\u2019s own lawyer and Michael Cohen and that this was an illegal contribution that renders the entire agreement void.\u201d\nA spokesman for Mr. Davidson said he couldn\u2019t comment in detail on attorney-client matters. \u201cMr. Davidson fulfilled his obligations and zealously advocated for Ms. McDougal to accomplish her stated goals at that time,\u201d said the spokesman.\nAfter initially passing on purchasing her story in June 2016, AMI showed renewed interest after Ms. McDougal entered negotiations to sit for an interview with ABC News, according to the complaint. The agreement prohibited her from giving press interviews or sharing on social media \u201cany romantic, personal and\/or physical relationship McDougal has ever had with any then-married man,\u201d according to a copy of the agreement reviewed by the Journal.\nAMI amended the agreement after Ms. McDougal switched lawyers in November 2016, according to the lawsuit. The change allowed her to respond to \u201clegitimate press inquiries.\u201d But the publisher has continued to instruct her to say nothing about her alleged relationship with Mr. Trump to reporters, the lawsuit says.\nAfter she declined to comment for a New Yorker story in July 2017, AMI\u2019s Mr. Pecker invited her to a meeting in New York and thanked her for her \u201cloyalty,\u201d and promised more magazine covers and exposure, the lawsuit says.\nBut the company threatened her with lawsuits and \u201cfinancial ruin\u201d after the New Yorker last month published a story based on handwritten notes by Ms. McDougal outlining her alleged affair with Mr. Trump, according to the lawsuit.\n\u200bThe AMI spokesman said Ms. McDougal has been free to respond to inquiries about her relationship with Mr. Trump since 2016.\nWrite to Joe Palazzolo at joe.palazzolo@wsj.com","1199":"By Claire Zillman March 7, 2018 \nOn Election Day 2016 it was white, at the Emmys it was black, and on International Women\u2019s Day, which lands on Thursday, March 8, it\u2019ll be purple. \nPurple is the official color of International Women\u2019s Day, founded more than a century ago after some 15,000 women marched in New York City to demand better working conditions and voting rights. The current iteration of the day is intended to celebrate women\u2019s social, economic, and political achievements and to call for gender equality. \nAnd given the variety of ways different nations celebrate the day\u2014from marches to cultural outings\u2014there\u2019s not an obvious wardrobe choice. The official International Women\u2019s Day website, IWD.com , has you covered there. It explains why purple is International Women\u2019s Day\u2019s shade of choice: \nInternationally, purple is a color for symbolizing women. Historically, the combination of purple, green and white to symbolize women\u2019s equality originated from the Women\u2019s Social and Political Union in the U.K. in 1908. Purple signifies justice and dignity. Green symbolizes hope. White represents purity, but is no longer used due to \u2018purity\u2019 being a controversial concept. The introduction of the color yellow representing a \u2018new dawn\u2019 is commonly used to signify a second wave of feminism. Thus purple with green represents traditional feminism, purple with yellow represents progressive contemporary feminism. \nIn the past year and a half, women have relied on clothing color as symbol of protest. It started in earnest with women wearing white on Election Day 2016 to pay homage to the historic nature of the contest, which saw Hillary Clinton run as the first female candidate from a major political party. Similar to U.K. history, white was an official color of the U.S. suffrage movement that took place early last century. Clinton supporters, in particular, latched onto the #wearwhitetovote movement after the candidate appeared at the third and final presidential debate in an all-white pantsuit. (She also wore white to the final night of the Democratic National Convention.) \nWomen have also relied on black in recent months as a nod to the #MeToo movement and as a statement against the abusive behavior of men. Female film industry elite famously wore black to the Emmy Awards in early January , flooding the red carpet with dark ensembles in a sign of protest against Hollywood\u2019s institutionalized sexism. \nDemocratic women in Congress picked up on Hollywood\u2019s cue, donning black for President Donald Trump\u2019s State of the Union speech in late January in protest of sexual harassment. The importance of #TimesUp & #MeToo is about more than demanding decency & respect \u2013 though that is certainly a major part of it. We must recognize & cherish the brave ppl who stand up to demand their stories be heard. I'm proud to know so many of my colleagues feel the same way. pic.twitter.com\/cwXD8t5JVM \n\u2014 Nancy Pelosi (@NancyPelosi) January 30, 2018 \nIf the choice of purple sounds familiar, it may be because Clinton wore a suit with a vibrant purple lapel as she gave her concession speech on November 9, 2016. Her husband Bill wore a matching purple tie. At the time, commentators suggested that the color was an acknowledgement of the shade\u2019s ties to the suffrage movement or its significance in Methodist tradition as a sign of royalty and penitence, since Clinton is Methodist. \nClinton later revealed in her book What Happened that the purple suit was supposed to illustrate bipartisanship. She had planned to wear white in the event of an election win but \u201cthe white suit stayed in the garment bag,\u201d she wrote. \n\u201cThe morning after the election, Bill and I both wore purple,\u201d she wrote. \u201cIt was a nod to bipartisanship (blue plus red equals purple).\u201d \n","2289":"114 COMMENTS A lawyer for Stephanie Clifford paid $25,000 on Monday to buy the rights to video footage of the former adult-film actress taking a lie-detector test about an alleged sexual encounter with President Donald Trump , the polygraph examiner who administered the test said.\nThe actress known professionally as Stormy Daniels took the test on May 19, 2011, in Las Vegas, according to a copy of the report by polygrapher Ronald Slay reviewed by The Wall Street Journal. She took the lie-detector test as part of an agreement to sell her story to Life & Style magazine for $15,000.\nMs. Clifford\u2019s interview with Life & Style wasn\u2019t published at that time and she was never paid, according to people familiar with the matter.\nMr. Slay\u2019s report said he found Ms. Clifford\u2019s responses about having unprotected sex with Mr. Trump in July 2006 to be truthful. His report said the test was inconclusive about the truth of her statement that Mr. Trump had promised her a spot on his reality show, \u201cThe Apprentice,\u201d according to the copy reviewed by the Journal.\n\u201cThere were no observable indications of intent to deceive,\u201d Mr. Slay\u2019s report said.\nMichael Avenatti, Ms. Clifford\u2019s lawyer, declined to comment. Mr. Avenatti posted a picture Tuesday morning on Twitter that appeared to be of Ms. Clifford taking a lie-detector test. His tweet said, \u201c#searchforthetruth\u201d and \u201cbuckle-up.\u201d\nThe Wall Street Journal reported in January that Ms. Clifford had been paid $130,000 in October 2016 by the president\u2019s personal lawyer, Michael Cohen, in exchange for signing a nondisclosure agreement about the alleged affair. The White House and Mr. Cohen have denied any affair occurred between Ms. Clifford and the president.\nThe two sides currently are involved in a legal battle over Ms. Clifford\u2019s claim that she is free to discuss the alleged sexual encounter with Mr. Trump. Mr. Trump\u2019s lawyer said in a court filing Friday that Ms. Clifford could be liable for more than $20 million in damages so far for alleged violations of the nondisclosure agreement.","2765":"Firearms maker Remington Outdoor Co. sought bankruptcy protection Sunday, in the face of a heavy debt load, falling sales and lawsuits tied to the Sandy Hook school shooting.\nRemington filed for chapter 11 protection in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Wilmington, Del., with plans to hand over control of the company to its creditors\u2014including Franklin Resources Inc. and JPMorgan Chase & Co.\u2019s asset-management division\u2014in exchange for wiping much of its debt from its balance sheet.\n...

The White House announced Hicks, 29, was leaving a day after she spent nine hours in a closed hearing of the House of Representatives Intelligence Committee on its investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 U.S. presidential election. White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders said Hicks\u2019 decision to leave was not related to her appearance before the panel, where lawmakers said she declined to answer questions about the administration. Trump called her \u201ca truly great person\u201d whom he would miss having at his side. The Republican president has presided over an extraordinary amount of turnover among senior staff in his White House since entering office more than a year ago. His first chief of staff, Reince Priebus, stepped down last summer, and his chief strategist, Steve Bannon was fired. Four people, including Hicks and former press secretary Sean Spicer, who also resigned, have held the communications director mantle. Hicks did more than steer messaging. She was a constant presence in Trump\u2019s orbit, sitting in on interviews with reporters and quietly steering press-related policy while maintaining a behind-the-scenes, low-but-glamorous-profile. Hicks managed in many ways to stay above the fray of staff backbiting and palace intrigue that has characterized the Trump White House, but her proximity to the president has made her a central figure in some of its more dramatic moments. Lawmakers said Hicks, Trump\u2019s spokeswoman during the 2016 election campaign, did answer House panel questions on Tuesday about her time with the campaign, and the transition months between the November election and the January 2017 inauguration. Hicks\u2019 exact departure was unclear but is expected to be sometime over the next few weeks. Hicks was caught up in a controversy surrounding former White House staff secretary Rob Porter, another close Trump aide, whom Hicks had been dating. She worked to defend him when charges of domestic abuse against his two former wives emerged. Porter was ultimately forced to resign. White House Communications Director Hope Hicks leaves the U.S. Capitol after attending the House Intelligence Committee closed door meeting in Washington, U.S., February 27, 2018. REUTERS\/Leah Millis A one-time aide to Trump\u2019s daughter, Ivanka Trump, and with no previous experience in politics, Hicks was one of the first people hired by the then-New York businessman when he began his campaign for the presidency. An aide said she had approached the president and told him she wanted to leave so she could start exploring opportunities outside of the White House. Robert Trout, a lawyer for Hicks who has represented her in the Russia investigation, declined comment. Slideshow (4 Images) Among the issues Hicks declined to discuss with the House panel was her part in drafting a statement in July 2017 misrepresenting a July 2016 meeting at Trump Tower that included the president\u2019s eldest son, Donald Trump Jr., other Trump associates and Natalia Veselnitskaya, a Russian lawyer. Trump Jr. said initially the meeting was about adoptions, but said later that Veselnitskaya had promised damaging information about his father\u2019s election campaign opponent, Democrat Hillary Clinton. U.S. intelligence agencies concluded that Russia ran a program of hacking and disinformation to interfere in the elections and it later developed into an attempt to help Republican candidate Trump defeat Clinton. On Feb. 16, a U.S. special counsel indicted 13 Russians and three companies on charges of tampering in the campaign. Russia denies interfering in the U.S. election and Trump denies any collusion between his campaign and Moscow officials. Hicks took over as communications director in September after the difficult, 11-day tenure of Anthony Scaramucci, who was fired. She is credited behind the scenes for stabilizing the communications operation. \u201cHope is outstanding and has done great work for the last three years. She is as smart and thoughtful as they come, a truly great person,\u201d Trump said in a statement released by the White House. \u201cI will miss having her by my side but when she approached me about pursuing other opportunities, I totally understood. I am sure we will work together again in the future.\u201d Hicks said in her own statement that \u201cthere are no words to adequately express my gratitude to President Trump. I wish the president and his administration the very best as he continues to lead our country.\u201d Reporting By Steve Holland and Jeff Mason; additional reporting by Karen Freifeld; Editing by Sandra Maler and Grant McCool","3595":"WASHINGTON\u2014Republican lawmakers on the House Intelligence Committee have drafted a report saying the panel\u2019s yearlong probe into Russian election interference found no evidence that Moscow colluded with Donald Trump\u2019s campaign or that the Kremlin favored Mr. Trump in the 2016 race.\nThe panel found \u201cbad judgment\u201d and some \u201cinappropriate meetings\u201d between members of the Trump campaign and Russians, but no sign that those amounted to collusion, said Rep.

The Republican president has renewed his Twitter attacks on both the Federal Bureau of Investigation and Mueller\u2019s probe since the firing on Friday of the bureau\u2019s former deputy director, Andrew McCabe, two days before he was eligible to retire with a full pension. Republican Senator Jeff Flake, who has criticized Trump harshly, said the president\u2019s latest comments appeared to be aimed at the firing of Mueller. Senator Lindsey Graham, another Republican, said if Trump were to dismiss Mueller it would mark \u201cthe beginning of the end of his presidency.\u201d AshLee Strong, a spokeswoman for Republican House Speaker Paul Ryan, said: \u201cAs the speaker has always said, Mr. Mueller and his team should be able to do their job.\u201d The comments underscored the risks for Trump if he goes too far to thwart the federal probe. \u201cI don\u2019t know what the designs are on Mueller, but it seems to be building toward that (firing him), and I just hope it doesn\u2019t go there, because it can\u2019t.

He called the Russia probe a politically motivated witch hunt. \u201cThe Mueller probe should never have been started in that there was no collusion and there was no crime,\u201d Trump said on Saturday. On Sunday, he attacked former FBI Director James Comey and McCabe, top officials who were involved in the Russia probe and subsequently fired. The U.S. intelligence community has concluded that Moscow conducted an influence campaign aimed at swaying the 2016 presidential election to Trump over Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton. Mueller is investigating the Russian meddling and any possible collusion with the Trump campaign. On Saturday, Trump\u2019s personal lawyer John Dowd urged the Justice Department official overseeing Mueller, Rod Rosenstein, to \u201cbring an end to alleged Russia Collusion investigation manufactured by McCabe\u2019s boss James Comey.\u201d FILE PHOTO: FBI Director Robert Mueller testifies before the House Judiciary Committee hearing on Federal Bureau of Investigation oversight on Capitol Hill in Washington, DC, U.S., June 13, 2013.

I see no cause when it comes to Mr. Mueller,\u201d Graham said on CNN. Another Republican, Senator James Lankford, said he does not believe Trump would fire Mueller. Trump also drew criticism from fellow Republicans on Sunday over the firing of McCabe, who said he believed he was targeted because he corroborated Comey\u2019s claims that Trump tried to pressure Comey into killing the Russia probe. \u201cI don\u2019t like the way it happened. He should\u2019ve been allowed to finish through the weekend,\u201d Senator Marco Rubio said on NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press.\u201d Rubio, who supports the special counsel probe, said the decision to fire McCabe was made before the release of the Justice Department inspector general\u2019s report that Attorney General Jeff Sessions cited in his dismissal.

Slideshow (2 Images) The patchwork of small towns, farms and Pittsburgh suburbs that make up Pennsylvania\u2019s 18th congressional district has been so staunchly Republican that Democrats did not field candidates in the previous two House elections. Come November, the district will cease to exist because boundaries have been redrawn. Both Lamb and Saccone are expected to run again, though in different districts. The election, held to replace a Republican who resigned amid a scandal last year, was the latest forceful electoral showing for Democrats, who also won a governor\u2019s race in Virginia and scored a U.S. Senate upset in conservative Alabama. Lamb\u2019s strong showing could buoy Democrats nationally as they seek to win control of the House from Republicans in the November elections. Democrats see 118 Republican-held districts in play. If they flip 24 seats, they could reclaim a House majority.

TRUMP\nTHE WHITE HOUSE,\nMarch 12, 2018.","8033":"1105 COMMENTS WASHINGTON\u2014The White House on Sunday announced a plan to reduce gun violence at schools that includes spending federal money on training school staffers to carry concealed weapons, but not President Donald Trump\u2019s earlier call to raise the age limit for buying guns.\nInstead, the plan creates a federal panel to study age restrictions and other potential changes in laws and to make recommendations later.\nThe White House blueprint, which comes in the wake of last month\u2019s mass shooting at a Parkland, Fla., high school , calls for \u201chardening our schools\u201d by instituting security procedures comparable to those in airports, sports stadiums and government buildings. One way to do that, the White House said, is to use Justice Department grants to train school personnel to carry weapons \u201con a voluntary basis.\u201d\nReducing School Gun Violence Here is a summary of the White House proposals.\nAssist states in training school staff in firearms use. Allow military veterans and retired police to work as school-safety personnel. Support legislation by Sens. John Cornyn (R., Texas) and Chris Murphy (D., Conn.) to improve background checks for gun purchases. Support the proposed STOP School Violence Act to provide funding for safety improvements including violence-prevention training for teachers and students. Call on states to allow police, with court approval, to remove firearms from people who are a threat to themselves or others. Ban \u201cbump stock\u201d devices that allow some firearms to function as machine guns. Form a commission to study age restrictions for gun purchases and the effects of violent video games and other entertainment and press coverage of mass shootings. \u201cThere\u2019s no time to waste,\u201d said Education Secretary Betsy DeVos, who presented the plan to reporters. The Wall Street Journal reported some of the details of the plan on Saturday.\nThe Trump administration plan also calls on states to adopt laws allowing police, with court approval, to remove firearms from people who are a threat to themselves or others and to temporarily prevent those people from purchasing new guns. \nThe plan also seeks improvements to mental-health systems to help identify and treat individuals who may be a threat. Those changes include increased integration of mental health, primary health care and family services.\nThe plan calls for improvements to the Federal Bureau of Investigation tip line, which was faulted for failing to act on warnings ahead of the Parkland shooting.\nThe blueprint contains Mr. Trump\u2019s support for two gun-related bills being considered by Congress, officials said. One, known as the \u201cFix NICS\u201d bill, is designed to improve background checks for gun purchases, although the measure has run into hurdles in Congress.\nThe second measure, the STOP School Violence Act, would authorize $50 million a year for school-safety improvements, including violence-prevention training for teachers and students.\n\u201cThe White House has taken tiny baby steps designed not to upset the NRA, when the gun violence epidemic in this country demands that giant steps be taken,\u201d Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D., N.Y.) said in a statement. \u201cDemocrats in the Senate will push to go further including passing universal background checks, actual federal legislation on protection orders, and a debate on banning assault weapons.\u201d\nMs. DeVos called the White House proposal a \u201cpragmatic plan to dramatically increase school safety.\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019ve had to talk about this topic way too much over the years,\u201d Ms. DeVos said about school shootings. \u201cThere\u2019s been a lot of talk in the past, but very little action.\u201d\nMs. DeVos will chair the new Federal Commission on School Safety, which would study issues such as increasing the age to buy some guns to 21, the effect of violence in videogames and movies on children, and identifying the best violence-prevention strategies.\nIn the wake of the school shooting in Parkland, Fla., that left 17 people dead, student survivors have started a movement for greater gun control. Two students from Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School explain how social media, crowdfunding and political activism have helped spread their message. Photo: Getty Images The creation of the commission comes a day after Mr. Trump, during a campaign rally in Pennsylvania , ridiculed similar panels that \u201cmeet and they have a meal and they talk.\u201d \u201cWe can\u2019t just keep setting up blue-ribbon committees,\u201d the president said.\nThere is no deadline set for Ms. DeVos\u2019s panel to present its findings, White House officials said. The officials also declined to comment on Mr. Trump\u2019s assessment of such commissions and said the age-restriction issue was \u201ca state-based discussion.\u201d\nMr. Trump has said repeatedly that he thinks the age limit to buy certain guns should be 21 years old, a restriction certain to draw the ire of the gun lobby if Mr. Trump\u2019s school-safety commission recommends the change. The National Rifle Association, the nation\u2019s leading gun lobby, sued the state of Florida over that issue after GOP Gov. Rick Scott signed a new gun law Friday. \nMr. Trump has held several meetings with lawmakers, school administrators, students and families who have suffered from gun violence, and NRA executives. During the meetings, the president has signaled his interest in a range of options and scrambled the traditional political lines on an issue that has divided Americans for decades.\nDuring one meeting, Mr. Trump dashed conservative hopes that he would support a proposal to allow gun owners who legally carry concealed firearms in one state to carry them in the other 49 states. The measure has long been a goal of the NRA and gun owners.\nHe also bucked Republican orthodoxy by suggesting the swift removal of guns from people who are potentially mentally ill.\nBut in recent weeks, Mr. Trump also has made clear his belief that \u201cgun-free zones\u201d make schools less safe, increasing the chances that gun massacres go unanswered.\n\u201cA gun-free zone is, \u2018Let\u2019s go in and let\u2019s attack, because bullets aren\u2019t coming back at us,\u2019\u201d Mr. Trump said at a meeting in February.\nPart of his response is to suggest that school staff members be armed, a move that has been opposed by gun-control advocates and teachers unions, but is favored by the NRA.\nThe Justice Department said Saturday that its bump-stock ban would amend the definition of machine guns in the National Firearms and Gun Control Act to include bump-stock-type devices. The regulation must undergo review by the Office of Management and Budget before it can take effect.\n\u201cPresident Trump is absolutely committed to ensuring the safety and security of every American, and he has directed us to propose a regulation addressing bump stocks,\u201d Attorney General Jeff Sessions said in a statement.\nBump stocks became part of the national conversation over gun control last year, when the devices were found on weapons used in the Las Vegas shooting that killed 58 people on Oct. 1.\nMr. Trump foreshadowed the bump-stock regulation at a cabinet meeting Thursday. \u201cBump stocks are just about finished, from the standpoint of getting the legal work done,\u201d Mr. Trump said.\nRelated \nLike the Big Kids, Kindergartens Plan Protests for Gun Control Florida Gov.

EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt speaks during a meeting held by U.S. President Donald Trump on infrastructure at the White House in Washington, U.S., February 12, 2018. REUTERS\/Kevin Lamarque \nEPA Administrator Scott Pruitt plans to sign a declaration by Sunday that the Obama administration\u2019s vehicle efficiency rules for 2022 through 2025 are \u201cnot appropriate\u201d and must be revised, Reuters reported last week. \nPruitt is expected to speak at an event at a Chevrolet dealership in suburban Washington and will joined by groups representing dealers and automakers, according to people familiar with the plans. \nThe state of California, which has the power to effectively create its own fuel economy standards, several allied states and environmental groups are gearing up for a legal and political fight over the rules, aimed at curbing greenhouse gas emissions from new cars and trucks. \nCalifornia Air Resources Board chair Mary Nichols said in January the board does not believe the standards should be lowered. Pruitt was in California earlier this week, but did not meet with Nichols. \nTwo administration officials and several automakers told Reuters the timing of proposing specific revisions to existing fuel economy standards and emissions limits remains in flux. EPA officials suggested a detailed proposal could come in late May or June, while the Transportation Department is pushing for a speedier proposal, automakers and officials said. \nThe EPA declined Thursday to comment on Pruitt\u2019s plans. An EPA spokeswoman said last week \u201ca final determination will be signed by April 1.\u201d \nAutomakers want rule changes to address lower gasoline prices and a shift in U.S. consumer preferences to larger, less fuel-efficient vehicles. \nAuto industry executives have not publicly sought specific reductions in the requirements negotiated with the Obama administration in 2011. But they have urged Pruitt and U.S. President Donald Trump to revise the Obama standards to make it easier and less costly to meet complex targets, which vary depending on the size of vehicles and whether they are classified as cars or trucks. \nOverall, the Obama rules called for roughly doubling by 2025 to about 50 miles (80 km) per gallon the average fuel efficiency of new vehicles sold in the United States. But the Obama rules included a review by April 2018 as to whether the final years were feasible or not. \nBy declaring the Obama rules \u201cnot appropriate,\u201d the Trump administration can reopen the process of setting vehicle targets agreed to by automakers in 2011. \nPruitt is expected to declare that the existing 2022-2025 model year rules on fuel economy must be revised but he is not expected to immediately propose new requirements, people familiar with the plans said. They asked not to be identified because they were not authorized to speak to the news media. \nThe so-called Corporate Average Fuel Economy rules sought to double the average fuel efficiency of automakers\u2019 fleets, or complete lineup of cars and light trucks, to about 50 miles (80 km) per gallon by 2025. \nWhile automakers want relief from the Obama rules, they are pressing the administration to avoid a battle with California and maintain a single, nationwide set of fuel efficiency requirements. \nIn New York, Toyota North America ( 7203.T ) Chief Executive Jim Lentz said at an Reuters event on Thursday that automakers would face higher costs if they had to manage fuel economy by each individual state. \nLentz said individual state emissions requirements could result in Toyota getting \u201ctowards the end of the year and I no longer can sell SUVs,\u201d depending on the state\u2019s fuel economy numbers. \u201cIt would be an absolute nightmare for us to figure out.\u201d \nWhen fuel rules were written in 2011 amid high gas prices, fuel efficiency was the second highest attribute considered by Toyota buyers, Lentz said.

Investigators said they have no clear idea what motivated the series of attacks, which began 17 days ago, and have publicly reached out to the bomber, urging him or her to contact them and explain what his demands are. The first three devices were parcel bombs dropped off at night in front of homes on the city\u2019s east side, with the fourth a trip wire device that went off in a west side neighborhood on Sunday. All four devices were similar, police said on Monday. \u201cWe are clearly dealing with what we expect to be a serial bomber at this point,\u201d Austin Police Chief Brian Manley told a news conference near the site of Sunday\u2019s bombing. Two men were injured on Sunday by the latest bomb, which police said may have been activated by a trip wire across a sidewalk. It was a more advanced design than the previous bombs. The men, 22 and 23 years old, were taken to a hospital with what police described as \u201csubstantial\u201d but not life-threatening injuries. Manley said more than 500 federal agents were involved in the investigation, including from the Federal Bureau of Investigation and U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives. \u201cThere is an army of law enforcement folks on the scene right now,\u201d Austin Mayor Steve Adler said on CNN. \u201cI am confident that we\u2019re going to find whoever is responsible for this and then we\u2019re going to stop it.\u201d FBI agents have swept the relatively affluent neighborhood called Travis Country where Sunday\u2019s bomb exploded and asked residents for home surveillance videos, residents said.

A few hours later, a third bomb injured the 75-year-old Hispanic woman, who has not been identified.

But this is a substance that is known to us and does not exist widely,\" Tillerson told reporters as he flew from Nigeria to Washington. \"It is only in the hands of a very, very limited number of parties.\" \nTillerson's statement represents a split from the White House's previous comments on the poisoning of former spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter. \nAsked whether the U.S. believes Russia was behind the attempted murder, and whether the U.S. will retaliate against Russia, White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders offered support for Britain \u2014 but avoided naming Russia in particular. \n\"Right now, we are standing with our U.K. ally. I think they're still working through even some of the details of that. And we're going to continue to work with the U.K., and we certainly stand with them throughout this process,\" Sanders said in a press briefing Monday. \nBritish Prime Minister Theresa May said that Novichock, the nerve agent used against Skripal and his daughter, was developed by the Soviet Union near the end of the Cold War. Skripal, 66, was a Russian military intelligence officer before flipping to the British side in the 1990s, going to jail in Russia in 2006 and being freed in an exchange of spies in 2010. Moscow has dismissed the suggestion it was involved in his March 4 poisoning as \"a circus show.\" \nTillerson, who spoke Monday by phone with British Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson, said he's grown \"extremely concerned\" about Russia, noting that he spent most of the first year of the Trump administration trying to solve problems and narrow differences with the Kremlin. He said after a year of trying, \"we didn't get very far.\" \n\"Instead what we've seen is a pivot on their part to be more aggressive,\" Tillerson said. \"And this is very, very concerning to me and others that there seems to be a certain unleashing of activity that we don't fully understand what the objective behind that is.\" \nHe said if the poisoning turned out to be the work of Russia's government, \"this is a pretty serious action.\" \n\"It certainly will trigger a response. I'll leave it at that,\" Tillerson said. \nTillerson, whose relationship with Russian President Vladimir Putin dates back to his days as Exxon Mobil 's CEO, has sought to work with Russia on narrow areas where the two countries could find common ground, such as a cease-fire in southwestern Syria that has largely held since last year. But those efforts have had diminishing results. Tillerson's efforts to persuade Moscow to stop propping up Syrian President Bashar Assad and to pull out of Crimea have yielded little to no progress. \nAt the same time, President Donald Trump 's critics regularly accuse his administration of failing to stand up to the Kremlin, especially over Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election. Russia hawks in Congress are particularly miffed that the State Department so far has declined to use a new law letting the U.S. slap sanctions on foreign companies or governments that do business with Russia's defense or intelligence sectors. Those powers took effect in January, but so far nobody has been punished. \n--CNBC's Kevin Breuninger contributed to this report.

","14107":"Andrew Harrer | Bloomberg | Getty Images Donald Trump \nAmerica First Policies, a nonprofit group with close ties to President Donald Trump , has hired Trump's pollsters to conduct a wide range of political polling and research that experts say resembles the kind of expensive work the Republican National Committee has performed for prior GOP administrations. \nSuch a practice breaks with decades of tradition and raises concerns about potential coordination between the pro-Trump dark money group, the White House and the RNC. America First Policies and the RNC have denied coordinating. The White House did not respond to multiple requests for comment. \nOver the past six months, CNBC has obtained more than 50 documents through an obscure portal on the America First Policies website. \nMuch of what the group polls and surveys would be standard work for a presidential campaign or a major political party. But America First Policies, which was founded days after Trump's inauguration, is not a campaign or a party. It's what the IRS calls a \"social welfare organization,\" permitted to operate tax-free and keep its donors secret as long as its main focus isn't politics and it doesn't coordinate with candidates. \nElection lawyers typically interpret this to mean 51 percent of a group's activities must be issue related. \"Our primary purpose has to be issue related, but that doesn't mean we can't throw in questions that are news related or political [in our polling],\" said Erin Montgomery, communications director for America First Policies. show chapters 10:29 AM ET Wed, 28 Feb 2018 | 01:03 \nLast summer, America First Policies took an unprecedented step for a politically allied nonprofit: It started using three top polling firms from Trump's 2016 presidential campaign to produce a steady stream of Trump-focused polls, strategy memos and reports that continue to this day. The three firms initially put their own logos on the polling they did for the group, but over time the America First Policies logo gradually replaced theirs on some of the documents. \nAmerica First Policies, which actively advocates for policies favored by Trump, denied that any of the documents, many of which are labeled \"confidential,\" were intended to benefit the White House or the president. \"We have very clear lines and high walls between us and the RNC or the administration or the Trump campaign,\" Montgomery said. \nYet the lines between the group, the White House and Trump's campaign are often blurred. \nThis week, Trump announced that Brad Parscale, a founder of America First Policies and a senior advisor to the group who also ran digital operations for Trump's 2016 campaign, will lead his 2020 re-election bid. \nFormer Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandowski, who is known to stay in close contact with Trump, is also a senior advisor to America First Policies. Last week, Lewandowski reportedly met with the president and chief of staff John Kelly in the Oval Office, two days before Trump gave a freewheeling, campaign-style speech at the annual CPAC conference. \nAnother key advisor to America First Policies, former Trump campaign spokeswoman Katrina Pierson, recently posted this photo of herself with the president online, from a White House reception ahead of Trump's first State of the Union address on Jan. 30. \nThis was three months after a group of senior advisors to America First Policies, including Lewandowski, Parscale and Executive Director Brian O. Walsh huddled with top Trump administration officials in the White House in late October, plotting strategies to push tax reform. \nMontgomery and Walsh both told CNBC that America First Policies gives its polling data to its allies while abiding by the \"high walls and clear lines\" separation from Trump. \nIn January alone, this data included more than a dozen surveys and memos on topics that ranged from marijuana legalization to how the White House handled the release of \"Fire and Fury,\" a tell-all book about the Trump administration. Some of these documents were posted online and then removed, while others remained posted. \n\"We share our polling with lots of outside groups and elected officials, and we put all of them up online,\" said Montgomery. \"I don't know if this information is ever shared with the White House. Anyone can see it.\" \n\"In the old world [of political polling], things were kept secret. In the new world, you make everything public,\" Walsh said. \nYet after CNBC spoke to Walsh and Montgomery on Wednesday, several of the research documents from January appeared to have been removed from the site by Thursday morning, including the results of polling on marijuana, analysis of how women view Trump , and January's polling results. \nDozens of other documents have also been removed from the site but left up on the web, apparently by accident. Walsh was under the impression that they had all been permanently deleted, and he accused CNBC of acquiring the reports from someone inside the group's network. Walsh also refused to share several additional documents that CNBC requested. \nA lot of what America First Policies has learned from its polling is not flattering to the Trump White House. Moreover, a significant portion of the polling shows that issues important to Trump are not necessarily important to voters. \nBelow are some of the key details spread throughout the group's research and polling: Building a wall along the southern border is not only unpopular with Democrats and independents. Even Trump's base voters ranked the construction of a wall as their least important policy issue in a January survey . A September poll showed that America First Policies was exploring ways to defeat Arizona Republican Sen. Jeff Flake in a primary, a month before Flake, a Trump critic, announced his retirement. According to the group's February polling, the largest percentage of voters agreed with Nancy Pelosi's comment that worker bonuses stemming from the GOP tax bill were \"crumbs\" compared with corporate windfalls. The February survey also found that only half of respondents agreed with Trump's plan for a military parade , while voters disagreed with the way he handled a scandal involving a senior White House aide accused of domestic abuse. \n\"AFP is doing the type of polling that would typically be done by a presidential campaign or a major party committee like the RNC or the DNC,\" said Brendan Fischer, an election law expert at the nonprofit Campaign Legal Center. \"So even though they claim to be committed to a set of issues, the available evidence here indicates that they're operating as a polling shop for the president.\" A door to a treasure trove of data \nAmerica First Policies reportedly raised $26 million last year for issue advocacy, but the \"Issue\" pages on its website do not appear to have been updated for months. \"This is supposed to be an organization dedicated to informing the public about issues, and yet its issue pages contain stale news stories and reports borrowed from other outlets,\" said Fischer. \nBut these pages of recycled reports are not where the real action is happening for America First Policies. Buried at the bottom of the group's homepage is a tiny, easily overlooked link labeled \"Data.\" \nBehind this link lies an entirely separate section of the website, divided into \"Survey Research,\" \"Social Media Reports\" and \"Other.\" \nAmerica First Policies posts new reports under Survey Research nearly every week. Sometimes there are social media reports on the page, and, other times, the group posts strategy memos and large collections of public polling and news articles. The latest addition to the survey research page was uploaded earlier this week: An 84-page summary of America First Policies' February national polling, available for download in a document format called Keynote, which can be converted to a PDF . \nAsked why the \"Data\" link was so small and difficult to see, while other tabs on the website were large and prominent, Montgomery responded, \"It's there on the homepage.\" She also said she plans to update the issue pages, but has been too busy with other tasks. \"We're not hiding anything,\" she said. \n\"I just put the link at the bottom of the page so I can find it easily,\" said Walsh, who said he notifies other like-minded groups when new data is posted to the site. \"We want to make sure it's publicly available,\" he said. Walsh refused to share additional polling that CNBC requested. \n\"If things get taken down [from the site], it's for server space,\" he added. The group removed several documents from the site after speaking to CNBC. \nIn February, the group measured support for Trump's proposed military parade; whether voters agreed with Trump's defense of former White House staff secretary Robert Porter, who is accused of spousal abuse; and whether voters believe the claims contained in the Nunes memo, in addition to other topics. (Half support the parade; voters don't agree with Trump about Porter, and voters don't believe the Nunes memo). Jonathan Ernst | Reuters White House Staff Secretary Rob Porter (L) reminds U.S. President Donald Trump he had a bill to sign after he departed quickly following remarks at his golf estate in Bedminster, New Jersey U.S.., August 12, 2017 \n\"So much of the information they're gathering is focused on the president himself and not necessarily his policies,\" said Geoffrey Skelley, associate editor of the nonpartisan campaign newsletter Sabato's Crystal Ball from the University of Virginia Center for Politics. Skelley questioned whether this could run afoul of campaign finance laws, which require nonprofit groups to disclose money they spend directly to benefit candidates. \nStephen Spaulding, a former special counsel at the Federal Election Commission and now director of strategy for the nonpartisan watchdog group Common Cause, agreed. \"There are ample grounds here to investigate whether America First Policies has been raising money that's subject to limits and disclosure requirements because it's being used for political purposes,\" he said. \nAsked specifically about the group's September poll that tested the best candidates in Arizona to knock out Flake in a GOP primary, Walsh said he was just \"scratching an itch\" when he commissioned it. The poll was conducted a few weeks after Trump openly called on Republicans to challenge Flake in a primary. At a Phoenix rally in August, he surprised aides by meeting backstage with two potential challengers and encouraged them to run. \nThe America First Policies polling effort operates as a network of coordinated groups, with two lesser-known firms, National Research Inc. and Baselice & Associates, working alongside a well-known Washington firm, The Polling Company, which was founded by former Trump campaign manager-turned-White House counselor, Kellyanne Conway. Mandel Ngan | AFP | Getty Images Trump campaign manager Kellyanne Conway. \nWhen Conway sold her firm in September 2017, The Polling Company had already been working for America First Policies for more than two months, judging from the company's logo on polls that it conducted for the group in June and July. \nConway was granted a special ethics waiver last June so she could engage in \"communications and meetings\" with former clients of The Polling Company without violating Trump's two-year ban on communications with former employers or clients. Conway has been called the \"Trump whisperer\" for her ability to influence the often mercurial president. In a 2016 interview with MSNBC, she described herself as a \"discreet advisor\" to Trump who was expected to use her data and strategy experience to help Trump craft his message. A break from the norm \nFor decades, White House pollsters for Republican presidents have been paid by the RNC, while the Democratic National Committee has paid for presidential polling during Democratic administrations. \nBut the prolific output of polling data from America First Policies has coincided with a steep drop in the amount of money the RNC spends on presidential pollsters, as compared with the first 12 months of previous Republican administrations dating back to the Reagan White House. \nAccording to FEC reports, the total amount that the RNC spent on Trump's campaign pollsters in 2017 amounts to just 5 percent of what the committee spent on Ronald Reagan's White House polling in 1981, adjusted for inflation, and around 12 percent of what it spent for President George W. Bush's pollsters in 2001. \nThis is partly due to a shift in the type of data system that is used by the RNC, away from traditional polling and toward a scoring system, according to an RNC official who spoke to CNBC on the condition of anonymity. \n\"Since 2013, we've spent $250 million to gather information through voter scoring, and we have a huge amount of information that informs these scores,\" the RNC official said. \"So, we don't really pay for traditional polling anymore. We rely on this data, instead.\" \nOn the rare occasions that traditional White House polling is needed, the RNC official said, the committee still relies on the president's preferred polling firms. This happened twice in 2017 and once again in January. \nTrump's top polling firms, meanwhile, do not come cheap. The three firms currently identified on some of America First Policies' documents charged the Trump campaign a combined $2.1 million for just two months' worth of polling during the final stages of Trump's 2016 presidential campaign, according to FEC filings. At these rates, the cost of the polling these firms have produced for America First Policies since last summer could easily be in the seven figures. \nYet ever since Trump was inaugurated, these same filings reveal that the rebooted Trump 2020 campaign has not spent any money on polling, despite raising $17 million last year. \n\"This looks like a million-dollar polling operation,\" said Spaulding, the former FEC special counsel, who reviewed the documents that CNBC downloaded. \"And this isn't the kind of issue polling you'd expect to see from an outside nonprofit: This is more like a shadow campaign on behalf of the president.\" \nMuch of the polling itself is deeply flawed, however, according to polling experts who reviewed the documents uncovered by CNBC. For example, America First Policies' pollsters frequently use leading questions, which make it clear that one answer is much better than other possible answers. The group also employs leading questions to test public opinion, skewing their own results and painting an incorrect picture of how voters feel about certain policy issues, like immigration and infrastructure. \n\"If you want to test a position, you test a position. If you want to test a message, you test a message. There's a time for both. But you don't deliberately f--- up the results of your position survey by dumping a message in front of it,\" said a veteran political pollster who spoke on the condition of anonymity. \"If you're trying to gauge a person's stance on asylum seekers, you don't taint your question with some bull---- about how violent MS-13 can be before you ask it. I mean, what good does that do? All it shows you is that scary things can scare people.\" \nAmerica First Policies' Montgomery acknowledged that some of the questions were leading, but said the ones she had helped to write were not leading. Walsh said the leading questions were actually just message testing. But message testing typically occurs only after public opinion has already been measured without the use of leading messages. Many of America First Policies' questions contain leading language the first time they appear on a survey. \nOne recent example of leading language was in a February poll's description of Trump's proposed military parade. Here, voters were asked whether they supported or opposed \"a military parade that honors our nation's veterans and the troops and families who sacrificed their lives for our country, as well as the strength of our military.\" \nIn another question from February, as shown in the above screenshot from one of the group's reports, respondents were reminded that large companies had given out employee bonuses before they were asked if they agreed with House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi 's comment that worker bonuses were \"crumbs\" compared with corporate windfalls. The results were surprising: A plurality of voters agreed with Pelosi, despite the lopsided question. This would suggest that for Republicans, using the \"crumbs\" comment as an attack line against Democrats in 2018 campaigns, which Trump has suggested they do, may not be a good idea. \nOver the past six months, CNBC monitored America First Policies' website and found hundreds of pages of polling and research paid for by donors whose names are permitted to be kept secret. Much of this polling has since been removed from the site, but a portion of the removed documents are still available online. \nAmerica First Policies is not the first nonprofit group created to advance a president's priorities, nor is it the first to conduct intensive polling. Two Obama-linked groups, Priorities USA and Organizing for Action, did the same thing. Priorities USA did not disclose its donors, but OFA did voluntarily, releasing quarterly donor lists. \nBut by hiring the Trump campaign's pollsters to conduct such a large and secretive Trump-focused data operation, and paying for it with dark money, America First Policies is going well beyond what previous outside nonprofit groups have done. \nWhile a political committee such as the RNC is designed and expected to collect information that helps to win elections, a nonprofit group such as America First Policies \u2014 permitted to operate tax-free and accept unlimited donations from donors whose names can be kept secret \u2014 is not. \n\"So you have a situation where large donors are contributing to America First Policies with the understanding that their secret donations are going to be seen as valuable by the president, because this group appears to work so closely with the White House,\" said Campaign Legal Center's Fischer. \"And because these donors are secret, the public and Congress will never know if the White House later took action to advance a donor's interests.\" \nIn addition to a slew of senior advisors with ties to Trump, America First Policies has three board members, all of whom are also close to the Trump White House. Its chairman, Tommy Hicks Jr., is the son of a billionaire and a good friend of Donald Trump Jr. He has also reportedly brokered White House introductions for companies seeking business with the Trump administration. \nAnother board member, Dallas financial executive Roy Bailey, serves as managing director and founding partner of Giuliani Partners LLC, along with former New York City mayor and longtime Trump ally Rudy Giuliani. The newest board member is Harold Hamm, a shale oil billionaire who was Trump's top pick for energy secretary but reportedly turned down the job. Andrew Harrer | Bloomberg | Getty Images Harold Hamm, chief executive officer of Continental Resources Inc., speaks during the Republican National Convention (RNC) in Cleveland, Ohio, U.S., on Wednesday, July 20, 2016. \nCNBC sent detailed questions to the White House about its relationship with America First Policies and asked what, if any, polling firms the Trump administration relies on to track public opinion and information for the president. The White House did not respond to multiple requests for comment. A murky new era of campaigning \nIn recent years, the laws that govern political spending and disclosure requirements have come under attack. \"Judicial rulings like [2010's] Citizens United and the explosion of outside funding groups that followed it have had a cumulative effect, loosening the rules around money in politics,\" said Skelley. \"The result is that there are a lot of gray areas in the law today, and there are a lot of different groups all trying to fill in the gray.\" \nIn this brave new world of often unlimited political money, some groups risk being left behind \u2014 and few more so than the two major party committees, the DNC and the RNC. The case of America First Policies only underscores how easy it is for one of the newer, less-constricted political groups to take over what had once been a core party function. \nYet the shift away from the traditionally intertwined relationship between the RNC and the president's pollsters is also part of a bigger trend, Skelley said. \"We've seen the political parties weakened in recent years, in terms of their control over their members and their policy agendas. America First Policies represents just another step in the waning influence of the party committees over how political activity in America is actually being conducted.\" \nIncreasingly, top-down party bureaucracies like the RNC and DNC are giving way to loosely aligned networks of dark money groups, super PACs, political campaigns and charities that may look distinct, but often share staff, vendors and office space with one another. \nThe nonprofit America First Policies has a sister political action committee, America First Action, which is also run by Walsh. \nAs a super PAC, America First Action must report its donors to the FEC, but in return for that transparency, it is permitted to spend all of its money helping to win elections. \nIn October of last year, America First Action launched a $100 million fundraising campaign with a series of events in Texas, including a donor meeting at the ranch of oil magnate T. Boone Pickens . There, Walsh reportedly made a pitch to donors about how America First Action was the only pro-Trump super PAC that had the president's blessing. \nAmong the attendees was Donald Trump Jr., who told the other guests that America First Action was the only outside group to which he would be donating. Between America First Action and America First Policies, Walsh said, more than $25 million had been raised so far that year. \n\"All these entities are indistinguishable from one another on the ground level,\" said Campaign Legal Center's Fischer. \"We have rules to guard against corruption and rules to help ensure transparency when money is being spent to influence elections. And it seems that there are grounds here to ask whether this group is just flouting those rules.\" WATCH: Former Trump official Rick Gates pleads guilty show chapters ","14389":"Donald Trump is holding a meeting with the video game industry Thursday, but the official list of attendees is very light on people who make games.\nOnly two publisher executives will be present, as will the head of the industry\u2019s trade group.

Truth is, they don\u2019t.\nIn 2017, in fact, shooting games made up just 27.5% of all video games sold, according to the NPD Group.

Special Counsel Robert Mueller has asked witnesses about Kushner\u2019s attempts to secure financing for his family\u2019s real estate ventures, focusing specifically on his talks with people from Qatar and Turkey, as well as Russia, China and the United Arab Emirates, NBC News said. NBC cited unnamed people familiar with Mueller\u2019s investigation, as well as witnesses who have been interviewed by Mueller\u2019s team. The special counsel is looking at Russia\u2019s alleged meddling in the 2016 U.S. presidential election and whether there was any collusion with the Trump campaign. A spokesman for Mueller\u2019s office, Peter Carr, declined to comment on the report. A spokesman for Kushner attorney Abbe Lowell said the report was the\u201cmischief\u201d of unnamed sources conducting a\u201cmisinformation campaign\u201d to mislead the news media. \u201cMr. Kushner\u2019s role in the campaign and transition was to be a point person for completely appropriate contacts from foreign officials and he did not mix his or his former company\u2019s business in those contacts,\u201d the spokesman, Peter Mirijanian, said in a statement.\u201cAny claim otherwise is false.\u201d Russia has denied interfering in the election, and Trump has said there was no collusion.

The Qatari officials decided against cooperating with Mueller for now out of fear it would further strain the country\u2019s relations with the White House, the individuals told NBC News. The Qatari embassy in Washington rejected the assertions, saying in a statement late Friday that its government\u201chas not been approached nor has it had any contact with the Special Counsel\u2019s Office on any matters.\u201d Kushner\u2019s family business, Kushner Companies, approached Qatar several times, including last spring, about investing in its troubled flagship property at 666 Fifth Avenue in New York, but Qatar\u2019s sovereign wealth fund declined, NBC News said, citing two sources familiar with the discussions. Muller\u2019s team also has expressed interest in a meeting Kushner held at Trump Tower in December 2016 with former Qatari Prime Minister Hamad bin Jassim bin Jaber al Thani, people familiar with the meeting told NBC News. The Kushner Companies\u2019 Fifth Avenue property is facing some $1.4 billion in debt that is due in 2019, NBC News cited the sources as saying. Talks with Qatari officials about investing continued after Kushner entered the White House and stepped away from the business, they said. After the collapse of talks between Qatar and the Kushner Companies, the White House strongly backed a blockade against Qatar by Saudi Arabia and the UAE, which accused Qatar of backing terrorism. Kushner has played a major role in Middle East policy. The Washington Post reported earlier this week that officials from the UAE, China, Israel and Mexico have talked privately about ways to manipulate Kushner using his business arrangements, financial difficulties and lack of foreign policy experience. The Post report quoted unnamed U.S. officials familiar with intelligence reports on the issue. Kushner has lost his access to top-secret U.S. intelligence information in recent weeks because of his inability to obtain a security clearance at that level.

May, who said on Monday it was \u201chighly likely\u201d that Russia was behind the poisoning of Sergei Skripal and his daughter, also won support from Britain\u2019s main European allies and the European Union, which denounced the attack as \u201cshocking\u201d and offered help to track down those responsible. Jens Stoltenberg, Secretary-General of the U.S.-led NATO alliance, said the attack was \u201chorrendous\u201d. Russia, however, signalled there was little likelihood that it would respond adequately to London\u2019s call for a credible explanation by Wednesday. Denying it had played any part in the attack, which left the 66-year-old Skripal and his 33-year-old daughter Yulia fighting for their lives, Russia said it would ignore the ultimatum until London handed over samples of the nerve agent used and complied with international obligations for joint investigations of such incidents. \u201cAny threats to take \u2018sanctions\u2019 against Russia will not be left without a response,\u201d the Russian foreign ministry said in a statement. \u201cThe British side should understand that.\u201d Russia holds a presidential election on Sunday in which Vladimir Putin, himself a former KGB spy, is expected to coast to a fourth term in the Kremlin. Skripal, a former officer with Russian military intelligence, betrayed dozens of Russian agents to British intelligence before being arrested in Moscow and jailed in 2006. He was released under a spy swap deal in 2010 and took refuge in Britain, where he had been living quietly in the cathedral city of Salisbury until he and his daughter were found unconscious on a public bench there on March 4. A British policeman who was also affected by the nerve agent is now conscious in a serious but stable condition. LETHAL NERVE AGENT May said on Monday Britain had identified the substance as belonging to the lethal Novichok group of nerve agents developed by the Soviet military in the 1970s and 1980s. She and her ministers say Britain will take further \u201crobust\u201d punitive action against Russian interests - beyond sanctions already in place - if Putin does not come up with a credible explanation of events.

They gave the British prime minister additional hope of marshalling Western backing for her government as it heads towards a showdown with Putin. \u201cPresident Trump agreed with Prime Minister May that the Government of the Russian Federation must provide unambiguous answers regarding how this chemical weapon, developed in Russia, came to be used in the United Kingdom,\u201d the White House said in a statement about the two leaders\u2019 phone call. \u201cThe two leaders agreed on the need for consequences for those who use these heinous weapons in flagrant violation of international norms,\u201d it said. May\u2019s spokesman said Trump had said the United States was \u201cwith the U.K. all the way\u201d. Slideshow (5 Images) If no satisfactory Russian response is received by midnight London time May is likely to outline Britain\u2019s response in parliament on Wednesday. It remains to be seen how much of a rupture in relations with Russia May\u2019s government is prepared to envisage. While trade figures show Russia accounts for less than 1 percent of British imports, London is of major importance for Russian companies seeking to raise capital and since the 1991 collapse of the Soviet Union has become the Western capital of choice for many Russian business leaders. Britain could call on allies for a coordinated Western response, freeze the assets of Russian business leaders and officials, expel diplomats or launch targeted cyber attacks. It may also cut back participation in the soccer World Cup which Russia is hosting in June and July.

Picture taken March 6, 2018. REUTERS\/Julio-Cesar Chavez Republican voters still outnumbered Democratic voters, by roughly 1.5 million to 1 million, in the first U.S. primary of the 2018 midterm elections. But Democrats showed gains in urban areas and with a rising Hispanic turnout, which political analysts attributed in part to dynamic Latina, or Hispanic women, candidates leading the resistance against Republican President Donald Trump. The population of Texas is about 40 percent Hispanic, and it has the longest border with Mexico of any U.S. state. Trump has angered some voters with his insults of Mexican immigrants and hard line on immigration combined with his past statements about grabbing women or barging in on their dressing rooms. \u201cIt\u2019s not just that the Hispanic intensity was up, but that intensity was heavily led by Latinas,\u201d said James Aldrete, head of Austin-based MAP Political Communication, which led former Democratic President Barack Obama\u2019s Hispanic media campaign. Across the United States, Hispanics are expected to be a crucial constituency in the November general election, when control of the U.S. Congress will be at stake. Democrats need to gain 24 seats nationwide to retake the House of Representatives. In Texas, Democrats nearly doubled their turnout in the top 15 counties in the state compared to the last midterm primary in 2014, outnumbering Republican voters by about one percentage point in those areas, according to Matt Barreto, co-founder of the polling and research firm Latino Decisions. Based on early voting totals, Hispanic voter turnout soared compared to the 2014 primary, albeit from a low base, Aldrete said. Hispanic turnout historically lags behind that of the wider electorate, so any uptick is closely analyzed.

Latinas may have led that surge. Hispanic women typically outpace Hispanic men by 2 to 3 percentage points in terms of registration or voter participation, said Lydia Camarillo, vice president of the nonpartisan Southwest Voter Registration Education Project, a Latino voter mobilization group based in San Antonio.

Republicans called Democratic celebrating premature, however, noting the strength of the two men at the top of their ticket, U.S. Senator Ted Cruz and Governor Greg Abbott, both of whom will be heavily favored to win re-election in November. Though Hispanics lean Democratic nationally - by roughly 70 percent to 30 percent in the 2016 presidential election - Republicans are more competitive among Hispanics in Texas.

Putin\u2019s victory, which comes at a time when his relations with the West are on a hostile trajectory, will extend his political dominance of Russia by six years to 2024. That will make him the longest-serving ruler since Soviet dictator Josef Stalin and has raised Western fears of spiralling confrontation. But Putin, 65, used a Kremlin meeting with the candidates he soundly defeated in Sunday\u2019s election to signal his desire to focus on domestic, not international, matters, and to try to raise living standards by investing more in education, infrastructure and health while reducing defence spending. \u201cNobody plans to accelerate an arms race,\u201d said Putin. \u201cWe will do everything to resolve all the differences with our partners using political and diplomatic channels.\u201d His comments, which are likely to be heard with some scepticism in the West following years of confrontation, mark a change in tone after a bellicose election campaign during which Putin unveiled new nuclear weapons he said could strike almost any point in the world.. German Chancellor Angela Merkel wished Putin success and called for more dialogue. But Russia is currently at odds with the West over Syria and Ukraine; allegations of cyber attacks and meddling in foreign elections; and the poisoning in Britain of a former Russian spy and his daughter. As a result, relations with the West have hit a post-Cold-War low. FREE AND FAIR? With nearly 100 percent of the votes counted, the Central Election Commission (CEC), announced that Putin, who has run Russia as president or prime minister since 1999, had won 76.69 percent of the vote. With more than 56 million votes, it was Putin\u2019s biggest ever win and the largest by any post-Soviet Russian leader. But the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE), a rights watchdog, said restrictions on fundamental freedoms, as well as on candidate registration, had restricted the scope for political engagement and crimped competition. \u201cChoice without real competition, as we have seen here, is not real choice,\u201d the OSCE said in a statement. The CEC said earlier on Monday it had not registered any serious complaints of violations. Backed by state TV and the ruling party, and credited with an approval rating of around 80 percent, Putin faced no credible threat from a field of seven challengers. His nearest rival, Communist Party candidate Pavel Grudinin, won 11.8 percent while nationalist Vladimir Zhirinovsky got 5.6 percent. His most vocal opponent, anti-corruption campaigner Alexei Navalny, was barred from running.

EXIT STRATEGY? Near-final figures put turnout at 67.7 percent, just shy of the 70 percent the Kremlin was reported to have been aiming for before the vote. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov played down suggestions that tensions with the West had boosted turnout, saying the result showed that Russians were united behind Putin\u2019s plans to develop the country. He said Putin would spend the day fielding calls of congratulation, meeting supporters, and holding talks with the losing candidates.

The Archdiocese of Los Angeles sued to block the sale in 2015, arguing the nuns did not have authority to sell the property to Hollister. A judge ruled in 2016 that the sale was invalid, paving the way for Perry to buy the site from the archdiocese.

It was installed near the Hollywood venue where the Academy Awards ceremony will be held. More than 70 women have accused Weinstein of sexual misconduct, including rape. Weinstein has denied having nonconsensual sex with anyone. His representatives did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the installation. The accusations against Weinstein triggered a flood of allegations of sexual impropriety by other celebrities that have rocked Hollywood and dominated this year\u2019s movie awards season. \u201cWhilst many thought the\u2018casting couch\u2019 was a thing of the past it was clearly still a part of the Hollywood culture,\u201d Plastic Jesus said in a statement on his Facebook page.

Mauser was one of a handful of gun control activists and volunteers who braved a frigid March morning to lay out about 7,000 pairs of shoes on the U.S. Capitol lawn as a makeshift memorial to American children killed by gun violence. Their aim, like the thousands of students across the country who plan to walk out of their classrooms for 17 minutes on Wednesday morning, was to put more pressure on state and federal lawmakers to tighten rules on gun ownership. \u201cThere\u2019s nobody in those shoes, it\u2019s like the emptiness in our hearts from gun violence,\u201d said Mauser, 66, of Littleton, Colorado. The memorial, organized by Avaaz, a U.S.-based civic organization, and the National School Walkout, organized by the activists behind the Women\u2019s March in Washington, are part of a grass-roots movement that grew out of the killing of 17 students and staff at a Florida high school a month ago. \u201cI think we\u2019re in the middle of a cultural change in the United States. The majority of Americans want a change in gun laws, and a majority of gun owners want change,\u201d said Emma Ruby-Sachs, deputy director of Avaaz. Many of the proposals favored by gun control advocates, including a ban on assault-style weapons and the closing of loopholes on requiring background checks before gun purchases, are fiercely opposed by the National Rifle Association and its supporters. The 7,000 pairs of donated footwear, arranged side by side in a trapezoid shape outside the Capitol, represent every person younger than 18 who has been killed by a firearm since the 2012 massacre at the Sandy Hook elementary school shooting in Newtown, Connecticut. Actresses Susan Sarandon and Bette Midler, and talk show host Chelsea Handler were among shoe donors.

On Wednesday, students will again take center stage in the political theater over guns that has gripped the country since the Feb. 14 shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida. Slideshow (9 Images) The national walkout will last 17 minutes, beginning at 10 a.m. local time, to commemorate the 17 victims who lost their lives in the Florida massacre. It was the deadliest school shooting since 20 children and six adults were shot dead at Sandy Hook more than five years ago. The walkout has won the support of many school districts and civil rights organizations, including the American Civil Liberties Union. More than 2,500 walkouts are scheduled across the country, according to the organizer\u2019s website, including at Marjory Stoneman and Columbine high schools. Mauser, a retired Colorado Department of Transportation employee, has attended dozens of gun-control demonstrations since the Columbine massacre. But he has grown cautiously optimistic about the prospects for change because of the new student involvement. \u201cThese kids, it\u2019s their lives. They\u2019re not going to be distracted about Russia, about other things,\u201d Mauser said.

Separately UK-based Financial.org has told investors it will close their accounts and take 20 percent of their money if they do not raise their minimum investment to $10,000 from $3,000, according to a notice posted on its website and seven investors from China, Malaysia, Singapore, Taiwan, Thailand, the UAE and Vietnam. Reuters reported in January that Financial.org is managing hundreds of thousands of dollars for Asian investors even though it is not licensed to engage in financial transactions. Investors said their money had been invested in U.S. stocks. Financial.org, which describes itself as an education business, is not on a publicly available list of firms authorized and regulated by the UK Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) to buy and sell stocks or bonds for clients. Offering investment services without regulatory permission is a criminal offence in Britain. \u201cThe FCA is conducting inquiries into the company\u2019s activities,\u201d the source told Reuters. Financial.org, a sponsor of British Formula One team Williams ( WGF1G.DE ), did not respond to a letter left at its address in London\u2019s Canary Wharf district and sent to two Financial.org email addresses. The company\u2019s phone number has been removed from its website and the number diverts to an answerphone which did not accept messages. Williams declined to comment. The FCA has warned of the dangers of investing through firms it has not authorized, as no independent checks have been made on their businesses. It says it received more than 8,000 reports of potential unauthorized activity in the last financial year. Last week, Indonesia\u2019s regulator, the OJK, placed Financial.org on an investor alert list and warned people away from the company. \u201cWe ask people who have put their money in this entity to take out the money immediately. If there is any civilian who has been harmed, please report to the police,\u201d Tongam Lumban Tobing, head of the financial regulator\u2019s investment alert task force, told Reuters. The Malaysian and Singaporean financial regulators last year placed Financial.org on alert lists of unauthorized investment firms with whom investors should exercise caution. TOP UP OR FACE FEE Financial.org posted a notice on a password-protected, members-only section of its website in January announcing the increase in the minimum investment, according to the seven investors. Two of them provided screenshots of the notice. The notice gave investors until March 31 to top up their accounts, after which it said accounts that did not meet the new threshold would be closed and investments returned in a lump sum \u201cwith a 20 percent account closure fee levied\u201d. Laith Khalaf, senior analyst at financial services company Hargreaves Lansdown, said it was highly unusual for regulated investment firms to require investors to top up their investments or to charge withdrawal fees.

","29636":"March 13, 2018 \/ 12:53 PM \/ in 40 minutes Trump fires Tillerson, a moderate; replaces him with hawkish spy chief Pompeo Roberta Rampton , Lesley Wroughton 8 Min Read WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump fired Secretary of State Rex Tillerson on Tuesday after a series of public rifts over policy on North Korea, Russia and Iran, replacing his chief diplomat with loyalist CIA Director Mike Pompeo. The biggest shakeup of Trump\u2019s Cabinet since he took office in January 2017 was announced by the president on Twitter as his administration works toward a potential meeting with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un after months of harsh rhetoric and rising tensions on Pyongyang\u2019s nuclear program. The rare firing of the United States\u2019 top diplomat capped months of friction between the Republican president and the 65-year-old former Exxon Mobil Corp chief executive. The tensions peaked last fall amid reports Tillerson had called Trump a \u201cmoron\u201d and considered resigning. Tillerson never denied using the word. Critics expressed dismay at the decision to swap out top diplomats so soon before the unprecedented meeting and worried that Pompeo would encourage Trump to scrap the 2015 Iran nuclear deal and be hawkish on North Korea. Critics said the move would sow more instability in the volatile Trump administration and marks the departure of another moderate who sought to emphasize the United States\u2019 strong ties to its allies amid Trump\u2019s criticism. Trump announced the changes in a morning Twitter post and later told reporters more about why he removed Tillerson. \u201cWe got along actually quite well but we disagreed on things,\u201d Trump said. \u201cWhen you look at the Iran deal: I think it\u2019s terrible, I guess he thinks it was OK. I wanted to break it or do something, and he felt a little bit differently.\u201d At the State Department, a visibly emotional Tillerson said Trump called him around noon from Air Force One, hours after he was summarily dismissed via Twitter. Tillerson also spoke with White House Chief of Staff John Kelly. He said his tenure ends on March 31 but he would delegate his responsibilities to John Sullivan, deputy secretary of state, at the end of Tuesday. \u201cWhat is most important is to ensure an orderly and smooth transition during a time that the country continues to face significant policy and national security challenges,\u201d Tillerson, whose voice quivered at times, told reporters in a packed briefing room. He pointedly declined to thank Trump personally or praise him, as he has done on previous occasions, but emphasized his strong relationship with Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis. Together, the two were seen as a moderating influence on some of Trump\u2019s policies. However, Tillerson, also presided over a State Department which saw its role vastly diminished, with several high-profile posts unoccupied and many allies questioning the efficacy of dealing with a diplomat they suspected never had Trump\u2019s ear. In contrast, Trump said he and Pompeo have \u201ca similar thought process.\u201d Pompeo, a former Army officer who represented a Kansas district in the House of Representatives before taking the Central Intelligence Agency job, is seen as a Trump loyalist who has enjoyed a less hostile relationship with career spies than Tillerson had with career diplomats. Trump chose the CIA\u2019s deputy director, Gina Haspel, to replace Pompeo there. A veteran CIA clandestine officer, Haspel is backed by many in the U.S. intelligence community but is regarded warily by some in Congress for her involvement in the agency\u2019s \u201cblack site\u201d detention facilities. Senior White House officials said Trump wanted his new team in place before any summit with Kim, who invited the U.S. president to meet by May after months of escalating tensions over North Korea\u2019s nuclear and missile programs. Tillerson listed several foreign policy objectives Washington was working on and singled out Russia for its \u201ctroubling behavior and actions.\u201d U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson speaks to the media at the U.S. State Department after being fired by President Donald Trump in Washington, U.S. March 13, 2018. REUTERS\/Leah Millis TILLERSON UNCLEAR ON REASON Stocks were lower in the afternoon, shaking off early gains on data showing slowing consumer price inflation, on uncertainty about Tillerson\u2019s dismissal and replacement by Pompeo. \u201cPompeo is known to be a real hawk on trade and foreign policy,\u201d said Jim Awad, senior managing director at Hartland & Co in New York. \u201cThere\u2019s nobody to be a check and balance on Trump. It\u2019s been unsettling to the market within the context of what we see now in the economy, which is a favorable backdrop.\u201d Tillerson\u2019s imminent departure had been rumored for several months, and Trump said he and Tillerson had discussed the move. State Department officials said Tillerson did not know why he was being pushed out and had intended to stay. One of them, Steven Golstein, was fired later on Tuesday, after he contradicted the White House\u2019s version. Foreign policy experts from Republican and Democratic administrations also questioned Trump\u2019s timing and choice, noting that Pompeo was known as a political partisan with hawkish views. Evans Revere, a former senior U.S. diplomat who dealt with North Korea under President George W. Bush, said Trump\u2019s move sends \u201ca bad signal about the role of diplomacy.\u201d \u201cTillerson\u2019s replacement by ... Pompeo, who is known as a political partisan and an opponent of the Iran agreement, raises the prospect of the collapse of that deal, and increases the possibility that the administration might soon face not one, but two nuclear crises,\u201d he said. Slideshow (9 Images) Senior White House officials said Chief of Staff Kelly had asked Tillerson to step down on Friday but did not want to make it public while he was on a trip to Africa. Trump\u2019s Twitter announcement came only a few hours after Tillerson, who cut his trip to Africa short, landed in Washington. Tillerson appeared to be caught by surprise last week when Trump announced he had accepted Kim\u2019s invitation to meet. Tillerson joined a long list of senior officials who have either resigned or been fired since Trump took office. OUT OF THE LOOP Trump publicly undercut Tillerson\u2019s diplomatic initiatives numerous times. Last year Tillerson said the United States was directly communicating with North Korea but that Pyongyang had shown no interest in dialogue. Trump contradicted Tillerson\u2019s efforts a day later.

","37399":"NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s plan to slap stiff tariffs on imported steel and aluminum has rattled financial markets and stirred fears that some trading partners might retaliate by dumping U.S. Treasuries.\nShould China, Japan and other nations, which have recycled their trade dollars through their Treasuries holdings, suddenly decide to whittle them down, markets could be in for a rough ride.\nSuch a retaliatory move, in the wake of Trump\u2019s first big protectionist action, comes at a time when foreign demand for U.S. debt is seen critical to offset an expected surge in federal borrowing needs, analysts and investors said on Friday.\n\u201cThe threats are real,\u201d said Kristina Hooper, chief global market strategist at Invesco in New York.\u201cWe need more foreign demand, not less.\u201d\nTo be sure, it is unlikely that Beijing, Tokyo and other overseas central banks would dump Treasuries altogether, if at all, analysts and investors said. Countries could wind up torching their own U.S. bond investments, without winning any guaranteed gains from Washington, they said.\n\u201cThey already own a lot of them. They would be shooting themselves in the foot,\u201d said Jack McIntyre, portfolio manager at Brandywine Global Investment Management in Philadelphia.\nStill what U.S. trading partners might do with their collective ownership of more than a quarter of all Treasury securities outstanding looms as a hefty risk not only for the bond market.\nTreasury yields are benchmarks for total returns on stocks and other assets. Typically when yields go up, stock prices fall. The yields are also used by banks and other lenders to determine what they charge consumers on mortgages and other loans. U.S. mortgage rates hit four-year highs last month.\n\u201cHIGH-PRESSURE\u201d RESPONSE\nTrump\u2019s announcement on Thursday of 25-percent and 10-percent levies on foreign steel and aluminum touched off outcries of unfair protectionism from trading partners, while it drew cheers from domestic producers as a move to combat questionable export practices by other countries.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a high-pressure response,\u201d said Jason Celente, senior portfolio manager at Insight Investment in New York.\nDetails of Trump\u2019s tariff plan are still unknown, and Celente said the tariffs might not be imposed at all after criticism from Republican lawmakers and U.S. industries heavily dependent on steel and aluminum.\nStill, Trump said\u201ctrade wars are good\u201d on Twitter on Friday, and the rhetoric has heated up. Canada and the European Union said they are ready to take countermeasures, while China urged Trump to show restraint.\n\u201cThe timing of this would be poor since the Treasury needs to tap the capital markets more than ever, in greater size, to pay for the plentiful tax cuts passed a few months ago,\u201d Kevin Giddis, head of fixed income capital markets with Raymond James in Memphis, Tennessee.\nThe massive tax overhaul enacted last December was projected to add up to $1.5 trillion to the U.S. debt load over a decade, while a two-year spending deal reached last month would add $300 billion to the deficit.\nAt the end of 2017, foreign governments owned $4.03 trillion or nearly 29 percent of the $14.47 trillion in Treasury securities outstanding.\nChina and Japan, two major U.S. trading partners, are also the top two foreign holders of Treasuries with a combined holdings of $2.25 trillion in December, Treasury data showed.\nIn 2017, the United States rang up a $375 billion trade deficit with China and a $69 billion trade gap with Japan, according to the U.S. Census.\nBOND YIELDS SEESAW Fears of a trade war have spooked Wall Street and caused the dollar to drop.\nThe debt market had a seesaw response on Thursday and Friday with investors firstly buying U.S. Treasuries as a safe haven and sending the benchmark 10-year note\u2019s yield US10YT=RR to a three-week low.\nThey reversed those bond positions on Friday, mostly due to worries that the Bank of Japan might exit its ultra-loose monetary policy. Investors also sold to make room for next week\u2019s heavy corporate debt supply.\nHowever, growing anxiety among traders about foreign retaliation through selling or buying fewer Treasuries may be coming into play, some investors and analysts said.\n\u201cYou can\u2019t rule it out.

U.S. President Donald Trump delivers remarks at the National Republican Congressional Committee's annual March dinner at the National Building Museum in Washington, U.S., March 20, 2018. REUTERS\/Leah Millis The developments increased legal pressure on Trump, who during and after the 2016 presidential campaign was accused of sexual misconduct by more than a dozen women, allegations he denied. A New York state judge on Tuesday denied a bid by Trump to toss a defamation lawsuit by Summer Zervos, a former contestant on NBC\u2019s \u201cThe Apprentice\u201d, raising the prospect that he might have to answer questions about his behavior in court. Justice Jennifer Schecter in Manhattan rejected Trump\u2019s claim that he was immune from being sued, finding \u201cabsolutely no authority\u201d to dismiss litigation related \u201cpurely to unofficial conduct\u201d solely because he occupied the White House. \u201cNo one is above the law,\u201d the judge wrote in her ruling. Playboy model Karen McDougal sued a media company that she said paid her $150,000 to keep quiet about an affair that she said she had with Trump. The lawsuit was the second time this month that a woman challenged legal arrangements to prevent discussions about affairs women said they had with Trump. Both involved payments that legal experts have said could equate to in-kind contributions to Trump\u2019s campaign in violation of federal election laws. The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Trump has denied all accusations of misconduct, and called his accusers \u201cliars.\u201d Zervos met Trump when she became a contestant on \u201cThe Apprentice\u201d in 2005. She said Trump kissed her against her will at a 2007 meeting in his New York office, and later groped her in a Beverly Hills hotel at a meeting about a possible job. Zervos said Trump\u2019s denials amounted to defamation and that being branded a \u201cliar\u201d caused diners to stay away from her restaurant in California. John Diamond, a professor at the University of California Hastings College of the Law, said Trump would have to testify under oath if he has to defend himself. McDougal filed her lawsuit in Los Angeles Superior Court against American Media Inc, publisher of the National Enquirer, whose head, David Pecker, has described Trump as a \u201cpersonal friend.\u201d McDougal said American Media paid her $150,000 in 2016 for the rights to her story that she had an affair with Trump in 2006 and 2007 and then never published it. McDougal said her lawyer at the time, Keith Davidson, secretly negotiated with Michael Cohen, Trump\u2019s personal lawyer, and that Cohen was in consultations with American Media on the agreement. Cohen has acknowledged arranging to pay to silence another woman, porn star Stormy Daniels. That payment was also made during the election campaign. Davidson said on Tuesday that he never had contact with Cohen during the McDougal negotiations. \u201cFalse allegations have been levied against me and I look forward to responding to them in an appropriate forum,\u201d he told Reuters. McDougal is asking the court to declare the agreement null and void. She said she was tricked into signing it, that it was intended to illegally influence the election and because it violates public policy against using threats of legal action to get someone to stay silent on issues of public concern. She also called the agreement an illegal donation from AMI to the Trump campaign in violation of federal election law. American Media said in a statement the company has a valid contract with McDougal and looks forward to reaching an amicable resolution. It said she has been free to respond to press inquiries about her relationship with Trump since 2016 and that the suggestion that American Media silenced her is without merit. Davidson declined to comment, citing attorney-client privilege. Cohen did not respond to a request for comment. Daniels, whose real name is Stephanie Clifford, sued the president on March 6, stating Trump never signed an agreement for her to keep quiet about an \u201cintimate\u201d relationship between them.

WSJ's Gerald F. Seib examined whether these moves could ignite a trade war with South Korea and China. Photo: AP (Originally published Jan. 24, 2018) Indeed, several people familiar with the process suggested that, despite the declarative statements from Mr. Trump and the official conducting the briefing, the contours of the package, including the possibility of exempting certain countries, could still change.\nSome officials were less definitive in their public statements about what had already been decided.\nCommerce Secretary Wilbur Ross attended a private White House meeting on Thursday that Mr. Trump held with steel and aluminum executives, where he discussed options under consideration. Asked on CNBC Friday whether the tariffs would cover every country, including allies, Mr. Ross replied: \u201cWell, that\u2019s what the president seemed to announce yesterday.\u201d\nMr. Trump and some aides embraced the controversy the tariff proposal had stirred up. \u201cWhen a country (USA) is losing many billions of dollars on trade\u2026trade wars are good, and easy to win,\u201d Mr. Trump tweeted early Friday morning.\n\u201cI don\u2019t believe any country in the world is going to retaliate for the simple reason we are the most lucrative and biggest market in the world,\u201d Peter Navarro, a White House trade adviser who pushed hard for the policy, told Fox News Friday. \u201cThey know they\u2019re cheating us. All we\u2019re doing is standing up for ourselves.\u201d\nGovernments around the world blasted Mr. Trump\u2019s plans, and issued threats of retaliation.\nPromising to \u201cdefend European jobs,\u201d European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker said \u201cwe must\u2026show that we also take measures.\u201d Mr. Juncker added: \u201cI don\u2019t like to use the word trade war, but I can\u2019t say how this wouldn\u2019t be war-like behavior.\u201d\nEurope has already put together a specific package of penalties that would hit a total of $3.5 billion in U.S. exports, a European Commission official said, including Harley Davidson motorcycles, bourbon and blue jeans.\nRoberto Azev\u00eado, director-general of the World Trade Organization, issued a rare rebuke to a member country, branding the Trump tariffs a cause for concern, and saying \u201cthe potential for escalation is real, as we have seen from the initial responses of others.\u201d He added: \u201cA trade war is in no one\u2019s interest.\u201d\nIn addition to stoking broad concern about the impacts of the tariffs, Mr. Trump has sown uncertainty by giving scant details about a far-reaching, complex economic policy.\nThe only public details that the president provided in his Thursday announcement were the top-line tariff figures, and that they would be imposed \u201cfor a long period of time.\u201d As for when the formal policy will be crafted, he said he \u201cwill probably have everything completed by next week.\u201d\nWhite House spokeswoman Sarah Huckabee Sanders has declined to provide any further details or elaboration. Asked Friday morning if even the main 25% steel and 10% aluminum tariffs were definitive, Ms. Sanders responded: \u201cI wouldn\u2019t expect those to change, but some of the other details need to be finalized.\u201d\nOne person outside the administration who has discussed the policies extensively with the Trump team said: \u201cThis president has provided a holographic image\u2014what you see depends on where you sit.\u201d The person added: \u201cDespite the two numbers he threw out, we still have all the same questions we\u2019ve had about the scope, coverage, duration and design.\u201d\nOne reason for the sparse details so far is that Mr. Trump overruled some of his staff\u2014including those crafting the documents\u2014in deciding to make an announcement this week. As word start leaking out Wednesday night that Mr. Trump planned to make public his policy the next day, some of the aides shaping it were caught by surprise, and said it wouldn\u2019t be ready in time.\nIt\u2019s still unclear whether a total package will be ready next week. The process surrounding the formation of the steel and aluminum tariffs is similar to the drafting last year of the administration tax proposal, when Mr. Trump on a Friday afternoon in April surprised his own staff by announcing that a plan would be unveiled the following Wednesday, when those involved were expecting the process to take a few more weeks. While they did stick to that deadline, the release was a general one-page outline lacking many details.\nOne of the most intense fights over the next week will be over whether to exempt Canada, the largest provider of foreign steel\u201416%\u2014consumed in the U.S., according to the Commerce Department figures.\nEven some of the biggest likely beneficiaries of the new tariffs are calling for Canada to be spared, as it was the last time the U.S. imposed broad steel tariffs in 2002.\n\u201cThe defense and intelligence relationship between the countries is unique and integral to our security,\u201d said Leo Gerard, president of the United Steelworkers union, which has members on both sides of the border. He said, \u201cAny solution must exempt Canadian production.\u201d\nPittsburgh-based Alcoa Corp. , the largest producer of raw aluminum in the U.S., is also seeking an exception for Canada, where it has smelters, stating that \u201cthe aluminum industry has an integrated supply chain\u201d across the continent.\nSome producers and unions have expressed concern about disrupting to interdependent production processes, where steel and aluminum products, in different stages of completion, regularly go back and forth across the borders among the U.S., Mexico and Canada.\nOne person who has consulted the Trump administration suggested that rather than refuse to grant those two countries exemptions, it might be using the prospect to extract concessions from them in talks continuing this week in Mexico City to rewrite the North American Free Trade Agreement.\nEven after the full tariff policies are completed and released, the Commerce Department will hear appeals from steel and aluminum consumers. They can petition for exemptions by arguing there is insufficient U.S. production to supply their needs, or that blocking imports would undermine national security. That process is expected to launch a lobbying frenzy from a wide array of industries seeking relief.\n\u2014Andrea Thomas in Berlin contributed to this article.\nWrite to Jacob M.

Emergency personnel with sniffer dogs searched for signs of life amid the wreckage of concrete slabs and twisted metal after the 950-ton bridge crushed vehicles on one of the busiest roads in South Florida. At least eight vehicles were trapped in the wreckage of the bridge and at least 10 people have been transported to hospitals, officials and doctors told news conferences. Witnesses told local media the vehicles were stopped at a traffic light when the bridge collapsed on top of them at around 1:30 p.m. ET (1730 GMT). \u201cWe\u2019re working our way into the pile trying to create holes that we can actually physically see,\u201d Miami-Dade Fire Department Division Chief Paul Estopian told reporters. At one point, police requested television helicopters leave the area so rescuers could hear for any sounds of people crying for help from beneath the collapsed structure, CBS Miami television said. Complicating the rescue effort was the uncertainty about the integrity of the bridge, parts of which remained off the ground, much of it inclined, local media reported. The 174-feet (53-meter) long bridge connects the university with the city of Sweetwater and was installed on Saturday in six hours over the eight-lane highway, according to a report posted on the university\u2019s website. \u201cIf anybody has done anything wrong, we will hold them accountable,\u201d said Florida Governor Rick Scott, at a Thursday night press conference, after his office issued statement saying a company contracted to inspect the bridge was not pre-qualified by the state. The bridge was intended to provide a walkway over the busy street where an 18-year-old female FIU student from San Diego was killed while trying to cross last August, according to local media reports. Students at FIU are currently on their spring break vacation, which runs from March 12 to March 17. \u2018A MIRACLE\u2019 Student Aura Martinez was having lunch in a nearby restaurant with her mother when a waitress told her the bridge had collapsed. She ran outside and helped pull a woman out of her car, most of which was flattened by the bridge. First responders are shown as rescue efforts continue after a pedestrian bridge collapsed at Florida International University in Miami, Florida, U.S., March 15, 2018. REUTERS\/Joe Skipper \u201cHer car, it was literally a miracle of God, her car got squished by the bridge from the back, so she was able to get out and she was on the floor and it was just very traumatic,\u201d she told the local CBS affiliate. To keep the inevitable disruption of traffic associated with bridge construction to a minimum, the 174-foot portion of the bridge was built adjacent to Southwest 8th Street using a method called Accelerated Bridge Construction (ABC). It was driven into its perpendicular position across the road by a rig in only six hours on Saturday, according to a statement released by the university. The $14.2 million bridge was designed to withstand a Category 5 hurricane, the most dangerous measure by the National Hurricane Center, and built to last 100 years, the university said. ( bit.ly\/2tQ2ARg ) The National Transportation Safety Board was sending a team to investigate why it collapsed. Slideshow (13 Images) President Donald Trump thanked first responders for their courage on Twitter. Along with Governor Scott, U.S. Senator Marco Rubio went to the scene of the collapse. Munilla Construction Management, which installed the bridge was founded in 1983 and owned by five brothers, according to its website. In addition to its Florida operations, the company also has divisions in Texas and Panama and employs 500 people. \u201cMunilla Construction Management is a family business and we are all devastated and doing everything we can to assist,\u201d the company said in a statement. FIGG Engineering said it took part in the bridge project and the collapse was a first in its 40-year history.

Colorado-based engineering company BDI said in a tweet on March 12 that it was \u201cthrilled\u201d to have conducted structural monitoring during the \u201cspectacular\u201d process of moving the bridge into place. The company removed the tweet on Thursday and said in a statement it did so out of respect for individuals affected by the collapse. Scott\u2019s office said FIU picked a firm that was not pre-qualified to check the design of the bridge, which was required because it was such a long pedestrian bridge and other unique characteristics. \u201cThe firm selected, Louis Berger, was not FDOT pre-qualified for this service, which is required under FIU\u2019s agreement with the state. FIU\u2019s design build team is responsible for selecting a pre-qualified firm and ensuring this process is followed,\u201d the governor said in a statement.

The pound surged on confirmation that Britain would remain effectively a non-voting EU member for 21 months until the end of 2020. Some business leaders, however, echoed a warning from EU negotiator Michel Barnier that the deal is legally binding only if London agrees the whole withdrawal treaty by next March. That means solving outstanding issues, notably how to avoid a \u201chard border\u201d that could disrupt peace in Northern Ireland. Britain says an EU-UK free trade deal to be sealed by 2021 can do that. But Dublin insists the Brexit treaty must lock in a \u201cbackstop\u201d arrangement in case that future pact does not work. Both sides are committed to keeping a free flow of people and goods over the intra-Irish border without returning to checkpoints, as during the three decades of violence in Northern Ireland. However, finding a practical solution for any customs checks needed post-Brexit has proved elusive so far. The dispute with Ireland had threatened to derail May\u2019s hopes of a formal political endorsement of the transition deal by EU leaders when they meet in Brussels on Friday. A weekend of intensive talks, however, has broken the deadlock \u2014 for now. Prime Minister Theresa May, who relies on pro-British Northern Ireland members of parliament to pass her Brexit legislation, had rejected a fallback proposed by Brussels three weeks ago. She said an EU offer to keep Northern Ireland under EU trade rules would isolate the province from the mainland. However, her Brexit Secretary David Davis, in Brussels, has now signed up to following similar principles as negotiators resume work to find an \u201coperational\u201d compromise. Dublin said it was happy to accept as it bound London in to not \u201cbacksliding\u201d on pledges May had made on the issue in December.. \u201cWe agree on the need to include legal text detailing the \u2018backstop\u2019 solution for the border,\u201d Davis told a news conference with Barnier. \u201cBut it remains our intention to achieve a partnership that is so close as to not require specific measures in relation to Northern Ireland.\u201d The question will remain as to whether negotiations on the future trade partnership between Britain and the EU, which are expected to start only next month after EU leaders endorse Barnier\u2019s negotiating guidelines on Friday, can produce results \u2014 and quickly enough to avoid having language in the withdrawal treaty that Britain, and May\u2019s Belfast allies, cannot accept. Her Democratic Unionist Party allies said the \u201cannouncement\u201d did not concern them as it left the border issue unresolved. Longer term, the transition deal may buy people time but business still faces a \u201ccliff edge\u201d of uncertainty come 2021. Britain's Secretary of State for Exiting the European Union David Davis and European Union's chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier address a joint news conference in Brussels, Belgium March 19, 2018. REUTERS\/Francois Lenoir \u201cDECISIVE DAY\u201d Davis agreed with Barnier that Monday\u2019s agreement was \u201cdecisive\u201d and increased the odds on finding an orderly deal to avoid Europe\u2019s second biggest economy simply crashing out of the bloc in just over a year. He hailed the certainty that the deals on the transition and other issues, including rights for expatriate citizens, would offer businesses and individuals. However, Barnier warned: \u201cA decisive step remains a step; we are not at the end of the road and there still remains a lot of work to be done, including on Ireland and Northern Ireland.\u201d The two sides issued a new, 129-page draft withdrawal treaty that was awash with green highlighter denoting final agreement on large areas of the legal text, including transition. Diplomats put the level of \u201cgreen\u201d agreement at over 80 percent. The pound rose as much as one percent against the dollar to $1.4088 GBP=D3 , its strongest since Feb. 16. Slideshow (8 Images) TRADE BENEFITS Davis, who unlike May campaigned for Brexit, said he was pleased with EU agreement to let Britain negotiate and sign trade deals with other countries while remaining covered by EU common trade policy during the transition. Those deals would then take effect once Britain was free to do so in 2021. He also welcomed wording that gives Britain some say in EU policy during the transition, notably on fishing quotas, and an ability to refuse to implement things it did not agree with \u2014 some of his Conservative party allies have complained that the transition deal would leave Britain a \u201cvassal state\u201d of the EU. The Leave Means Leave campaign accused him of \u201ccaving in\u201d on the Irish border.

Trump has said he would consider a wide range of policy options, but has not yet clarified his positions on how best to address gun violence.

The president\u2019s free-wheeling deliberations on gun violence during the past month have mainly taken place in full view of reporters. Thursday\u2019s session was closed to media shortly before it began when an unrelated event was added to Trump\u2019s schedule. The conversation lasted for almost an hour and was \u201cvigorous\u201d but \u201crespectful,\u201d and Trump seemed to be interested in hearing from all sides, said Melissa Henson of the Parents Television Council, a group that advocates against violence and sex in entertainment.

The video game industry has said there is no evidence of a connection between its product and violent conduct. The Entertainment Software Association, a lobby group that includes Electronic Arts Inc, Activision Blizzard Inc, Nintendo Co Ltd, Sony Corp and Tencent Holdings Ltd, was part of the White House meeting. The video game makers and their lobbyist who were in the meeting did not immediately respond to requests for comment. ZeniMax and Take-Two were also part of a White House discussion on the same issue five years ago after a shooting at a Newtown, Connecticut elementary school left 26 dead. Afterward, then-President Barack Obama, a Democrat, pressed for Congress to give the Centers for Disease Control $10 million to research the causes of gun violence, including the role played by video games.

Some congressional Democrats have blocked the legislation over safety concerns, and Monday\u2019s fatality could hamper passage of the bill, congressional aides said Monday. Safety advocates called for a national moratorium on all robot car testing on public roads. \u201cArizona has been the wild west of robot car testing with virtually no regulations in place,\u201d said Consumer Watchdog, a non-profit consumer advocacy group, in a statement. \u201cThat\u2019s why Uber and Waymo test there. When there\u2019s no sheriff in town, people get killed.\u201d Arizona has opened its arms to companies testing self-driving vehicles as a means to economic growth and jobs. Republican Governor Doug Ducey reached out to Uber in 2016 after California regulators cracked down on the company over its failure to obtain testing permits. Slideshow (5 Images) Self-driving cars being tested routinely get into fender-benders with other vehicles. Last week, a self-driving Uber crashed with another vehicle in Pittsburgh, local news reported. There were no injuries. A year ago, Uber temporarily grounded its self-driving cars for a few days following a crash with another car in Tempe. The company has been the subject of a number of complaints about its autonomous vehicles, but the company has said the cars were being driven by a human driver at the time of the incidents. ESSENTIAL TO UBER\u2019S SUCCESS Uber has said its ability to build autonomous cars is essential to its success in the rapidly changing transportation industry. The company envisions a network of autonomous cars that would be summoned through the Uber app that would supplement - and eventually replace - human-driven cars. Related Coverage U.S. safety agencies probing fatal self-driving Uber car crash Uber has logged 2 million self-driving miles (3.2 million km) through December. The company has more than 100 autonomous cars testing on the roads of the greater Phoenix area, the company\u2019s prime testing ground due to the state\u2019s loose regulations and hospitable weather. Rain, snow and ice are particularly challenging for autonomous cars. The company also tests in Pittsburgh and Toronto. Concerns over the safety of autonomous vehicles flared after a July 2016 fatality involving a Tesla Inc automobile with a partially autonomous system that required human supervision. Safety regulators later determined Tesla was not at fault. Uber has weathered a series of crises, including sexual harassment claims, using a tracking tool to avoid government officials, and a lawsuit brought by competitor Waymo alleging theft of self-driving trade secrets. Uber settled that lawsuit last month for $245 million. That settlement was largely seen as a means for Uber to resume work on autonomous cars without the distraction of litigation, as it hustles to catch up with Waymo, widely seen as having the most advanced cars in the industry.

FILE PHOTO: Saudi Arabian women, seeking a job, talk with recruiters during a job fair in Riyadh January 25, 2012. REUTERS\/ Stringer With the ascent to power of young Prince Mohammad bin Salman, the kingdom has seen an expansion in women\u2019s rights including a decision to allow women to attend mixed public sporting events and the right to drive cars from this summer. The changes have been hailed as proof of a new progressive trend toward modernization in the deeply conservative Muslim kingdom, although the gender-segregated nation continues to be criticized for its continued constraints on women. \u201cThe laws are very clear and stipulated in the laws of sharia (Islamic law): that women wear decent, respectful clothing, like men,\u201d Prince Mohammed said in an interview with CBS television aired late on Sunday. \u201cThis, however, does not particularly specify a black abaya or a black head cover. The decision is entirely left for women to decide what type of decent and respectful attire she chooses to wear.\u201d A senior cleric said last month that women should dress modestly, but this did not necessitate wearing the abaya. It remains unclear if these statements signal a change in the enforcement of women\u2019s dress code in the kingdom. Saudi Arabia has no written legal code to go with the texts making up sharia, and police and judiciary have long enforced a strict dress code requiring Saudi women to wear abayas and in many cases to cover their hair and faces. But the kingdom has witnessed a cautious new climate of social freedoms with the rise of the 32-year-old crown prince to power after decades of elderly rulers. Saudi women have started wearing more colorful abayas in recent years, the light blues and pinks in stark contrast with the traditional black. Open abayas over long skirts or jeans are also becoming more common in some parts of the country. On March 8, a group of women in the Saudi city of Jeddah marked International Women\u2019s Day by exercising one of their newly acquired freedoms: the right to go for a jog, paying no heed to bemused onlookers. However, activists have blasted the country\u2019s continued guardianship system requiring a male family member to grant permission for a woman to study abroad, travel and other activities. Last week, a U.N. rights watchdog called on Saudi Arabia to end discriminatory practices against women including male guardianship, and give them full access to justice.

The case centered on the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program created in 2012 under Democratic former President Barack Obama that Republican President Donald Trump already has sought to rescind. Those who signed up for DACA are shielded from deportation and given work permits. The high court refused to hear Republican-governed Arizona\u2019s appeal of a lower court ruling that barred the state from denying driver\u2019s licenses to people protected under DACA. \u201cArizona\u2019s inexplicable attempt to deny driver\u2019s licenses to Dreamers, pursued by two governors for years, has now failed at every level of the federal judiciary,\u201d said Jennifer Chang Newell, an attorney at the American Civil Liberties Union, which represented the immigrants in the case. The justices on Feb. 26 required the Trump administration to keep DACA in place at least for now, turning away its appeal of a judge\u2019s nationwide injunction that halted the president\u2019s September order to begin winding down the program in March. A second federal judge has since issued a similar injunction.

Non-citizens must prove they are authorized to be in the United States to obtain an Arizona driver\u2019s license, such as with a valid federal work permit. The state decided not to accept permits obtained by DACA recipients. The ACLU sued on behalf of a group of DACA recipients who were denied driver\u2019s licenses. Arizona was the only state to deny licenses to DACA recipients, according to court papers. The San Francisco-based 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals last year struck down the Arizona policy, ruling that the state cannot develop its own definition of immigrants who are authorized to be in the United States and that only the federal government had that power. Arizona appealed to the Supreme Court, saying the 9th Circuit\u2019s decision ran roughshod over state sovereignty. Arizona said DACA was enacted through a Department of Homeland Security memo, not legislation in the U.S. Congress or a formal agency rule-making process, and could not supersede state law regulating driver\u2019s licenses. The Trump administration urged the justices not to take the case, saying the president\u2019s move to rescind the policy means the state\u2019s concerns have already been addressed.

A lawyer for Trump filed the arbitration proceeding against Daniels last week to seek a restraining order to \u201cshut her up\u201d and \u201cprotect Mr. Trump,\u201d her lawsuit claims. Daniels, whose legal name is Stephanie Clifford, has said she is taking legal action to be able to speak freely about her relationship with Trump without fear of legal retribution. Clifford is among a number of women who have spoken up about sexual encounters with Trump, who has denied the accusations. Her lawsuit claims Trump and his lawyer Michael Cohen have made a concerted effort to silence her for more than a year. According to the lawsuit, Trump never signed a non-disclosure agreement arranged between Cohen and Clifford to keep her quiet about their alleged affair. Trump\u2019s failure to sign the \u201chush agreement\u201d renders the pact invalid and she is free to talk about their relationship, the lawsuit claims. Clifford\u2019s relationship with Trump began in the summer of 2006, not long after Trump\u2019s wife Melania gave birth to their son Barron, and lasted well into 2007, according to the lawsuit. Reuters could not independently confirm any of the allegations. Trump has denied he had an affair with Clifford.

One of Thanathorn\u2019s uncles served as transport minister under Thaksin and politicians from Thaksin\u2019s camp have been more welcoming of Thanathorn\u2019s party than the ultra-royalists. But Thanathorn\u2019s party has barely started to build the grassroots structures that helped parties linked to Thaksin win every election since 2001. In a pro-Thaksin stronghold in Bangkok, only a few kilometres from where Thanathorn launched his party, most of more than 20 people asked by Reuters said they had not heard of him.

Lynch 6 Min Read WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions fired the FBI\u2019s former No. 2 official Andrew McCabe on Friday, prompting McCabe to say he was targeted for being a witness into whether President Donald Trump tried to obstruct the probe of Russian meddling in the 2016 election. Sessions, in a statement on Friday, said he felt justified in firing McCabe after the Justice Department\u2019s internal watchdog found he leaked information to reporters and misled investigators about his actions. \u201cThe FBI expects every employee to adhere to the highest standards of honesty, integrity and accountability,\u201d Sessions said. But McCabe, who played a crucial role in the bureau\u2019s investigations of Hillary Clinton and alleged Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. election, denied those claims and said he is facing retaliation by the Trump administration. In a lengthy statement, McCabe said he believes he is being politically targeted because he corroborated former FBI Director James Comey\u2019s claims that Trump tried to pressure Comey into killing the Russia probe. McCabe kept detailed notes about his interactions with Trump, a source familiar with the matter said. Comey kept similar memos. Their notes and memos could become evidence in Special Counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s probe into possible collusion between Moscow and Trump\u2019s campaign. Trump, who has denied any collusion, ousted Comey last year and acknowledged in a televised interview that he fired him over \u201cthis Russia thing.\u201d Comey\u2019s ouster paved the way for Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein to tap Mueller to lead the probe. McCabe\u2019s dismissal came two days before his 50th birthday, when he would have been eligible to retire from the Federal Bureau of Investigation with his full pension. The firing - nine months after Trump fired Comey - puts the pension in jeopardy. It also is likely to raise questions about whether McCabe received an overly harsh punishment due to political pressure by the Republican president, who had called for McCabe\u2019s removal and blasted him on Twitter. \u2018SINGLED OUT\u2019 \u201cI am being singled out and treated this way because of the role I played, the actions I took, and the events I witnessed in the aftermath of the firing of James Comey,\u201d McCabe said in his statement. \u201cThis attack on my credibility is one part of a larger effort ... to taint the FBI, law enforcement, and intelligence professionals more generally.\u201d In a message on Twitter, Trump praised McCabe\u2019s firing and blasted both him and Comey. Trump wrote: \u201cAndrew McCabe FIRED, a great day for the hard working men and women of the FBI - A great day for Democracy. Sanctimonious James Comey was his boss and made McCabe look like a choirboy. He knew all about the lies and corruption going on at the highest levels of the FBI!\u201d McCabe had stepped down from his position as FBI deputy director in January but remained on leave pending retirement. His departure was triggered by a critical report from the Justice Department\u2019s inspector general that eventually led the FBI\u2019s Office of Professional Responsibility to recommend he be fired. FILE PHOTO: Acting FBI Director Andrew McCabe testifies before a Senate Intelligence Committee hearing on Capitol Hill in Washington, D.C., U.S., June 7, 2017. REUTERS\/Aaron P. Bernstein\/File Photo The report, which has yet to be made public, says McCabe misled investigators about his communications with a former Wall Street Journal reporter who was writing about McCabe\u2019s role in probes tied to Clinton, including an investigation of the Clinton family\u2019s charitable foundation. In his statement, McCabe denied misleading investigators. He added that the release of the inspector general\u2019s report was \u201caccelerated\u201d after he testified behind closed doors before the U.S. House Intelligence Committee where he revealed he could back up Comey\u2019s claims. POTENTIAL CRUCIAL WITNESS Comey\u2019s firing has become central to questions about whether Trump unlawfully sought to obstruct the Russia investigation. McCabe could potentially be a crucial witness in Mueller\u2019s investigation. Trump and other Republicans have accused McCabe, a lifelong Republican who worked at the FBI for more than 20 years, of political bias and conflicts in connection with his oversight of investigations related to Clinton. Some of that criticism stemmed from the fact his wife, Jill McCabe, a Democrat, received donations for her unsuccessful 2015 Virginia state senate campaign from Terry McAuliffe, who was the state\u2019s governor at the time and an ally of the Clintons. McCabe did not start overseeing the investigations until after his wife\u2019s campaign ended, the FBI has said, and therefore did not have a conflict of interest. On Twitter last year, Trump questioned why McCabe was allowed to oversee an investigation into Clinton\u2019s use of a private email server while his wife received donations from \u201cClinton puppets.\u201d He said McCabe was \u201cracing the clock to retire with full benefits.\u201d Related Coverage","49559":"March 12, 2018 \/ 10:45 PM \/ Updated 17 minutes ago Trump signs order prohibiting Broadcom takeover of Qualcomm Reuters Staff 1 Min Read WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump issued an order on Monday prohibiting Broadcom Ltd\u2019s ( AVGO.O ) proposed takeover of Qualcomm Inc ( QCOM.O ) on grounds of national security.

Sessions testified before Congress in November 2017 that he \u201cpushed back\u201d against the proposal made by former campaign adviser George Papadopoulos at a March 31, 2016 campaign meeting. Then a senator from Alabama, Sessions chaired the meeting as head of the Trump campaign\u2019s foreign policy team. \u201cYes, I pushed back,\u201d Sessions told the House Judiciary Committee on Nov. 14, when asked whether he shut down Papadopoulos\u2019 proposed outreach to Russia. Sessions has since also been interviewed by Mueller. Three people who attended the March campaign meeting told Reuters they gave their version of events to FBI agents or congressional investigators probing Russian interference in the 2016 election. Although the accounts they provided to Reuters differed in certain respects, all three, who declined to be identified, said Sessions had expressed no objections to Papadopoulos\u2019 idea. One person said Sessions was courteous to Papadopoulos and said something to the effect of \u201cokay, interesting.\u201d The other two recalled a similar response. \u201cIt was almost like, \u2018Well, thank you and let\u2019s move on to the next person,\u2019\u201d one said. However, another meeting attendee, J.D. Gordon, who was the Trump campaign\u2019s director of national security, told media outlets including Reuters in November that Sessions strongly opposed Papadopoulos\u2019 proposal and said no one should speak of it again. In response to a request for comment, Gordon said on Saturday that he stood by his statement. Sessions, through Justice Department spokeswoman Sarah Isgur Flores, declined to comment beyond his prior testimony. The special counsel\u2019s office also declined to comment. Spokeswomen for the Democrats and Republicans on the House Judiciary Committee did not comment. Reuters was unable to determine whether Mueller is probing discrepancies in accounts of the March 2016 meeting. The three accounts, which have not been reported, raise new questions about Sessions\u2019 testimony regarding contacts with Russia during the campaign. Sessions previously failed to disclose to Congress meetings he had with former Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak, and testified in October that he was not aware of any campaign representatives communicating with Russians.

A criminal charge would require showing Sessions intended to deceive. Sessions told the House Judiciary Committee that he had always told the truth and testified to the best of his recollection. Legal experts expressed mixed views about the significance of the contradictions cited by the three sources. Sessions could argue he misremembered events or perceived his response in a different way, making any contradictions unintentional, some experts said. Jonathan Turley, a law professor at George Washington University, said Sessions\u2019 words might be too vague to form the basis of a perjury case because there could be different interpretations of what he meant.

But now you have multiple places where Sessions has arguably made false statements,\u201d said Bennett Gershman, a Pace University law professor. The March 2016 campaign meeting in Washington was memorialized in a photo Trump posted on Instagram of roughly a dozen men sitting around a table, including Trump, Sessions and Papadopoulos. Papadopoulos, who pleaded guilty in October to lying to the Federal Bureau of Investigation about his Russia contacts, is now cooperating with Mueller. According to court documents released after his guilty plea, Papadopoulos said at the campaign meeting that he had connections who could help arrange a meeting between Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin. Papadopoulos continued to pursue Russian contacts after the March 2016 meeting and communicated with some campaign officials about his efforts, according to the court documents. Trump has said that he does not remember much of what happened at the \u201cvery unimportant\u201d campaign meeting. Trump has said he did not meet Putin before becoming president.

Toys R Us' failure to translate the joy of toys into something more tangible in its stores was one of its biggest mistakes. \nAnother would be losing touch with the parents who shopped in its stores. \n\"I remember when I first got there, walking into the first meeting with the executive committee thinking, 'This is going to be interesting.

I saw the excitement in their eyes and I thought, 'this is what Toys R Us is.'\" \n\"I think,\" said Kornblum, \"we just lost that.\" Competition bubbles \nIn its neglect, Toys R Us let the toys it sold become a commodity. That left it vulnerable when the most potent competitors it had to yet to face began to move in. \nThe dot-com bubble arrived and EToys, the internet toys start-up founded in 1997, went public two years later. It had a market capitalization that surpassed Toys R Us. \nIn need of a quick internet strategy, Toys R Us signed on to an expensive partnership with Amazon in 2000. The deal, one of the first of its kind, gave Amazon the exclusive rights to sell Toys R Us products on its website. Toys R Us paid it roughly $50 million a year, according to reports at the time. Getty Images A shopper exits the Times Square Toys 'R' Us store with his purchases in New York. \nToys R Us had paid for exclusivity, but it didn't get it. Amazon created a marketplace where it began selling others' toy brands. \nToys R Us sued Amazon to get out of the contract. But the legal wrangling set it back financially, and left it even further behind in its e-commerce efforts. By the time the lawsuit was settled, Amazon paid $51 million to end the suit. However, the damage was done and the retailer was way behind in the e-commerce fight. \nThen, came the discount chains. Walmart , Target and Kmart began going after the same moms who shopped in Toys R Us stores, slashing toy prices to bring them in. The core reason for Toys R Us existence \u2014 toys for kids \u2014 was being used by those bigger retailers as a way to get moms in the door, hoping they'd also spend on higher-margin products. \nUnder assault, Toys R Us stock tumbled. Private equity prey \nAll of this turned Toys R Us into perfect private equity bait. The mid-2000s were a boom for leveraged buyouts of retailers. The private equity funds were lured in by a combination of low interest rates, the recognizable names of the targets and the view that retailers' steady cash flow would continue forever. \nIn 2006 alone, private equity firms spent $30 billion on leveraged buyouts of retailers \u2014 more than they had spent in total since 1998. \nA hotly competitive sale of Toys R Us put the company into the hands of a trio of investors: KKR , Bain and Vornado . Together they paid $6.6 billion for the store in 2005, a deal they financed largely with debt. They saw value in its real estate and an opportunity to aggressively expand in Asia. The hope was to revive the company and take it public, using those proceeds to pay down the debt. \nThough its owners took no dividends, that debt became an albatross for the toy retailer \u2014 sucking money out of it year after year. Toys R Us annually had to divert its cash flow to pay $400 million to service its more than $5 billion in debt, it later said in court filings. As the retail industry changed in ways no one expected, Toys R Us was crippled, unable to make the investments it needed. \n\"These substantial debt service obligations impair the company's ability to invest in its business and future. As a result, the company has fallen behind,\" CEO Dave Brandon would tell the bankruptcy court.

So few asylum seekers crossed the U.S. border illegally over the years that Canada didn\u2019t consistently track the numbers. That has changed dramatically over the past 14 months. U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s crackdown on illegal immigration and his move to strip Haitians, Salvadorans and others of their temporary legal status have had a broad effect on Canada\u2019s refugee system, Reuters interviews with social service providers, government officials and a review of Canadian immigration data show. More than 20,000 people, including thousands of Haitians and Nigerians and hundreds of Turks, Syrians and Eritreans, have crossed the border into Canada illegally over the past year in search of asylum, many fleeing in fear that Trump would deport them to their home countries. This unexpected northward migration has overwhelmed Canada\u2019s system for processing asylum claims, leading to the worst delays in years. Aid agencies are also struggling to house asylum-seekers because of a shortage of accommodation in the four cities most affected by the migration wave - Toronto, Montreal, Winnipeg and Vancouver. (For graphics on the impact see tmsnrt.rs\/2HCp4aD ) While some of this has been reported, this story offers the most complete picture to date of the unintended effect of Trump\u2019s immigration policies on the United States\u2019 northern neighbor. The Canadian government was forced to set aside C$173 million in its latest budget to pay for extra patrols at border crossings to cope with the influx, as well as security screening and processing of refugee applications. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau\u2019s government has discussed the situation with the Trump administration, but it has been careful not to publicly blame the U.S. president\u2019s policies for triggering the migration wave. Nevertheless, it is already making preparations for more people to cross the border once the weather warms. \u201cWe will be ready,\u201d Immigration and Refugee Minister Ahmed Hussen said in an interview. Aid agencies who are at the forefront of dealing with the influx say they are struggling and need more funding, a comprehensive long-term plan and better coordination with Ottawa. \u201cIt\u2019s going to get worse. The numbers keep climbing,\u201d said Ilona Beiks, vice president of the Inland Refugee Society of British Columbia, which had to turn away refugees last year for the first time in its 35-year history because it did not have enough money to cope with the growing number of asylum seekers. The influx shows no signs of abating. More than 1,500 asylum seekers walked across the border in January. Those working with refugee claimants say this is no blip: It\u2019s the new normal. Since January 2017 Reuters has sought to obtain the numbers of asylum seekers who walked across the U.S. border into Canada in the years prior to Trump\u2019s election. The Canadian government has said no national historical data is available. WORSENING DELAYS Trump\u2019s tougher immigration policies have had a major impact on Canada\u2019s Immigration and Refugee Board, which determines refugee claims. It has become so overwhelmed with cases it is ignoring legislated time limits for dealing with them. All refugee claims are supposed to be processed within 60 days. Increasingly, the board has failed to meet those targets. In December 2017, 86 percent of hearings did not happen within prescribed time frames, according to previously unpublished data reviewed by Reuters. That was up from 66 percent in December 2016, a month after Trump was elected president, and 26 percent in December 2015. On Feb. 20 the board said it will effectively prioritize those applicants who have been waiting months or years. This will mean a longer wait for more recent arrivals than the current 20-month average estimated time for processing claims. The government is \u201ccommitted to an efficient and fair asylum system,\u201d said a spokesman for Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada, the government department responsible for the Immigration and Refugee Board. Canada\u2019s refugee tribunals have historically been leery of claims made by people who come through its wealthy southern neighbor. But of the more than 2,500 claims finalized last year, 53 percent were granted refugee status. Rulings reviewed by Reuters indicate the tribunals are giving credence to claimants who say they feared deportation or racist attacks following Trump\u2019s election on a platform advocating more restrictions on immigration. The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment. A girl waits with her family before crossing the US-Canada border into Canada in Champlain, New York, U.S., February 14, 2018. REUTERS\/Chris Wattie ACCOMMODATION SQUEEZE Asylum seekers are walking across the border into some of the tightest housing markets on the continent. Last summer, thousands slept in Montreal\u2019s Olympic stadium. In Toronto, 31 percent of the people sleeping in city-run shelters in January were refugee claimants \u2013 up from nearly 19 percent a year ago, according to city data. In November, Toronto approved the booking of more hotel rooms for refugee claimants through the end of 2018, at a cost of about C$20 million, according to city documents. The city is working on a more comprehensive refugee plan but it needs more help from the federal government, said councilor Kristyn Wong-Tam. The status quo, renting thousands of hotel beds, \u201cis absolutely unsustainable,\u201d she said. \u201cWe are not saying \u2018No\u2019 to refugees. We are saying, \u2018Absolutely: Come and live in Toronto. Build your life in Toronto.\u2019 But we cannot do this without the support of other orders of government,\u201d she said. Toronto\u2019s mayor \u201chas raised this issue repeatedly with the federal government,\u201d the mayor\u2019s spokesman, Don Peat, wrote in an email. The federal government says it won\u2019t give cities more money for asylum seekers, who are barred from accessing a C$762 million federal fund that is for permanent residents or people who have already been granted refugee status. Slideshow (14 Images) A spokesman for Hussen, the immigration minister, said asylum seekers can access provincial programs. Some agencies Reuters spoke with, however, said that isn\u2019t enough and that a national effort is needed. Toronto is not alone in asking for help. Vancouver has asked the British Columbia provincial government for more money for refugee aid agencies, said city spokesman Jag Sandhu, and the province has promised C$6 million a year over three years. Winnipeg is coordinating with the Manitoba government to find accommodation for refugee claimants, the city said. \u2018WE\u2019RE STRUGGLING\u2019 Canada has no formal system for integrating refugee claimants and depends heavily on aid agencies that operate independently but are funded through a combination of government grants and private donations. Dozens of agencies in Toronto, Winnipeg, Vancouver and Montreal are taking the lead in housing and feeding new arrivals and helping them find schools and employment. Of 17 organizations Reuters spoke with, 11 said interviews with border crossers confirmed that many were fleeing because of Trump\u2019s immigration policies. \u201cWe know the numbers have increased because of what\u2019s going on in the U.S.,\u201d said Toronto-based doctor Meb Rashid, who runs the provincially funded Crossroads Clinic. The number of patients at the clinic grew 40 percent in a year and people now wait several weeks for an appointment, Rashid said. \u201cWe\u2019re struggling, I have to be honest with you.\u201d Two aid groups said they have had to turn people away, one has had to intensify its fundraising, two have had to extend their operating hours to meet demand, while six who help to house new arrivals are struggling to find accommodation for them. The Manitoba Interfaith Immigration Council in Winnipeg has seen its refugee claimant caseload increase fivefold in the past year, said executive director Rita Chahal. \u201cThe impact has been huge,\u201d she said, adding that the organization had to launch its first fundraising drive in years to meet the additional costs. The Canadian government has dispatched lawmakers to diaspora communities in the United States to persuade people not to come. But it has said little about what conversations it has had with Washington on stemming the migration. The spokesman for Hussen, the immigration minister, said Canada has a \u201clong-standing, solid working relationship\u201d with the United States. Meanwhile, the contingency plans being developed to deal with the expected surge in border crossers include redeploying police and border agents to overwhelmed areas and setting up accommodation such as tents and trailers at ports of entry, said a spokesman for the Canada Border Services Agency. \u201cThere is an expectation the numbers will go up ... as the weather gets better,\u201d said a source familiar with the Canadian government\u2019s thinking. \u201cAnd who knows what the next order coming from down south will be?\u201d Reporting by Anna Mehler Paperny; Editing by Ross Colvin","55058":"Steve Goldstein, Rex Tillerson's top spokesman at the State Department, was fired Tuesday for contradicting the official administration account of Tillerson's firing, a White House official told NBC News.\nA State Department official confirmed the firing of Goldstein, who was an undersecretary of State, to NBC News, as well.\nGoldstein had only been in post since Dec. 4. \nTrump announced over Twitter on Tuesday that he was replacing Tillerson with CIA Director Mike Pompeo. \nGoldstein had said soon afterward that Tillerson had not spoken directly about the move with the president.\nAlex Edelman | picture-alliance | dpa | AP Irwin Steven Goldstein, of New York, during his confirmation hearing to be Under Secretary for Public Diplomacy at the United States Department of State, before the United States Senate Foreign Relations Committee on Capitol Hill in Washington, D.C. on November 1st, 2017. \"The Secretary had every intention of remaining because of the tangible progress made on critical national security issues,\" a statement issued by Goldstein had said.\n\"The Secretary did not speak to the President this morning and is unaware of the reason, but he is grateful for the opportunity to serve, and still believes strongly that public service is a noble calling and not to be regretted.\"\nNBC News reported that Tillerson had learned of his firing from Trump's tweet. \nTweet \nGoldstein had been senior vice president of BP Global Solutions before joining the State Department.\nAlex Wong | Getty Images U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson speaks to members of the media at the State Department October 13, 2017 in Washington, DC.

","56339":"Trump Tweet \nTrump and some Republicans in Congress have accused McCabe of political bias, citing his role at the FBI during investigations related to Hillary Clinton and Trump. They question his role in the Clinton email probe and the investigation into Russian efforts to influence the 2016 election and whether the Trump campaign coordinated with the Kremlin. \nThe president had thrown jabs at McCabe in a manner unusual for a president and a top FBI official. Trump repeatedly accused McCabe of improper ties to Clinton because former Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe \u2014 a Clinton ally \u2014 backed McCabe's wife's run for a state office in 2015. The Wall Street Journal reported in October 2016 that McAuliffe's political organization gave nearly $500,000 to Jill McCabe's campaign for state Senate. \nThe FBI had said McCabe followed the proper steps to avoid conflicts of interest. His wife's run for office also started months before he had any role in the Clinton probe. \nMcCabe released a statement on his firing. Here's what he wrote: \nI have been an FBI Special Agent for over 21 years. I spent half of that time investigating Russian Organized Crime as a street agent and Supervisor in New York City. I have spent the second half of my career focusing on national security issues and protecting this country from terrorism. I served in some of the most challenging, demanding investigative and leadership roles in the FBI. And I was privileged to serve as Deputy Director during a particularly tough time. For the last year and a half, my family and I have been the targets of an unrelenting assault on our reputation and my service to this country. Articles too numerous to count have leveled every sort of false, defamatory and degrading allegation against us. The President's tweets have amplified and exacerbated it all. He called for my firing. He called for me to be stripped of my pension after more than 20 years of service. And all along we have said nothing, never wanting to distract from the mission of the FBI by addressing the lies told and repeated about us. No more. The investigation by the Justice Department's Office of Inspector General (OIG) has to be understood in the context of the attacks on my credibility. The investigation flows from my attempt to explain the FBI's involvement and my supervision of investigations involving Hillary Clinton. I was being portrayed in the media over and over as a political partisan, accused of closing down investigations under political pressure. The FBI was portrayed as caving under that pressure, and making decisions for political rather than law enforcement purposes. Nothing was further from the truth. In fact, this entire investigation stems from my efforts, fully authorized under FBI rules, to set the record straight on behalf of the Bureau, and to make clear that we were continuing an investigation that people in DOJ opposed. The OIG investigation has focused on information I chose to share with a reporter through my public affairs officer and a legal counselor. As Deputy Director, I was one of only a few people who had the authority to do that. It was not a secret, it took place over several days, and others, including the Director, were aware of the interaction with the reporter. It was the type of exchange with the media that the Deputy Director oversees several times per week. In fact, it was the same type of work that I continued to do under Director Wray, at his request. The investigation subsequently focused on who I talked to, when I talked to them, and so forth. During these inquiries, I answered questions truthfully and as accurately as I could amidst the chaos that surrounded me. And when I thought my answers were misunderstood, I contacted investigators to correct them. But looking at that in isolation completely misses the big picture. The big picture is a tale of what can happen when law enforcement is politicized, public servants are attacked, and people who are supposed to cherish and protect our institutions become instruments for damaging those institutions and people. Here is the reality: I am being singled out and treated this way because of the role I played, the actions I took, and the events I witnessed in the aftermath of the firing of James Comey. The release of this report was accelerated only after my testimony to the House Intelligence Committee revealed that I would corroborate former Director Comey's accounts of his discussions with the President. The OIG's focus on me and this report became a part of an unprecedented effort by the Administration, driven by the President himself, to remove me from my position, destroy my reputation, and possibly strip me of a pension that I worked 21 years to earn. The accelerated release of the report, and the punitive actions taken in response, make sense only when viewed through this lens. Thursday's comments from the White House are just the latest example of this. This attack on my credibility is one part of a larger effort not just to slander me personally, but to taint the FBI, law enforcement, and intelligence professionals more generally. It is part of this Administration's ongoing war on the FBI and the efforts of the Special Counsel investigation, which continue to this day. Their persistence in this campaign only highlights the importance of the Special Counsel's work. I have always prided myself on serving my country with distinction and integrity, and I always encouraged those around me to do the same. Just ask them. To have my career end in this way, and to be accused of lacking candor when at worst I was distracted in the midst of chaotic events, is incredibly disappointing and unfair. But it will not erase the important work I was privileged to be a part of, the results of which will in the end be revealed for the country to see. I have unfailing faith in the men and women of the FBI and I am confident that their efforts to seek justice will not be deterred. \nFor more details, see the NBC News report here . \n\u2014CNBC's Jacob Pramuk contributed to this report.","56420":"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Puerto Rico\u2019s benchmark bond surged to a 25-week high on Monday, its busiest trading day since October, after the bankrupt U.S. territory nearly doubled its projected five-year surplus to $6 billion as it recovers from Hurricane Maria.\nWhile the price rise is being taken as a sign the market is beginning to see a recovery path for the storm-ravaged island, analysts remained wary, taking the spike with a grain of salt.\nGeneral obligation bonds maturing in 2035 changed hands more than 100 times on Monday and traded as high as 45 cents on the dollar, the bond\u2019s highest level since Oct. 3. 74514LE86=MSRB\nWhile still down sharply from the 60-cent range the bonds had occupied before Maria struck on Sept. 20, prices are continuing a steady, month-long climb as the island\u2019s recovery prospects improve.\nSenior bonds backed by sales tax revenue, so-called COFINA debt, have fared even better, reaching 63.51 cents in light trading on Monday, higher than they were in the weeks before the storm. 74529JAR6=MSRB Bonds issued by the bankrupt Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority (PREPA) also gained ground.\nThe latest bounce came on the heels of a revised financial outlook - released without fanfare by Puerto Rico\u2019s government on Friday - that projected the U.S. territory to accumulate a $6 billion surplus over the next five years.\nAn earlier version of the so-called fiscal turnaround plan, released in February, had forecast the surplus at $3.4 billion.\n\u201cPuerto Rico GO bond prices have more than doubled since their lows earlier in the year and other issues, including COFINAs, PREPAs and even National- and AMBAC-insured bonds, have all participated in this broad rally,\u201d Daniel DiBono, manager of municipal high yield evaluations at Thomson Reuters Pricing Service (TRPS), said, noting the revised surplus projections.\nShare prices for insurers of Puerto Rican bonds also rose. MBIA ( MBI.N ), the parent company of National Public Finance Guarantee Corp, was up 4.4 percent on Monday, while shares of AMBAC Financial Group ( AMBC.O ) gained 6.56 percent.\nThe fiscal turnaround plan will serve as a basis for creditor restructuring talks in Puerto Rico\u2019s bankruptcy, which, with $120 billion of combined bond and pension debt, was already the largest in U.S. government history before Maria trashed the island\u2019s infrastructure and killed dozens.\nThe plan needs approval by a federal board tasked with managing the island\u2019s finances. The board was expected to approve the February version of the plan at a meeting on Monday, but postponed the meeting after Friday\u2019s revision.\nObservers cast a skeptical eye on the rosier projections, unsure the board would go along with them. Puerto Rico Governor Ricardo Rossello and the board have butted heads for months over what the plan should include.\nThe new plan creates $3 billion more in cost savings than the February version, including an extra $1.34 billion in tax measures like changing minimum tax rates and reducing incentives.\n\u201cWhile these headlines appear positive, we continue to think there will be a lot of noise before there is any significant resolution in Puerto Rico,\u201d analysts at KBW Research said in a Monday note.\nChris Ryon, a portfolio manager at Thornburg Investment Management in Santa Fe, which does not own Puerto Rican bonds, said he was scratching his head over the spike.\n\u201cI guess hope springs eternal,\u201d Ryon said. \u201cI don\u2019t see the numbers working out in that way, that favorably.

The Dow Jones industrial average closed more than 400 points lower as all three major indexes fell more than 1 percent.\n\"The market is concerned this is just the beginning of a tit-for-tat exchange between the U.S. and its trading partners,\" David Lefkowitz, senior Americas equity strategist at UBS Wealth Management's Chief Investment Office, said in a phone interview. \"I think it's really not a big deal. ... the biggest thing is it creates some uncertainty.\"\nOne concern is that China, the largest foreign holder of U.S. Treasurys, may decide to reduce its purchases. That would add to recent upward pressure on yields, which move inversely to prices. A four-year high in the 10-year Treasury yield helped trigger U.S. stocks' first correction in two years in early February.\n\"They're definitely going to fire another shot at Trump on the long bond,\" said Larry McDonald, managing director at ACG analytics, referring to the longer-dated Treasurys.\nIn January, Bloomberg reported, citing sources, that senior government officials in Beijing are recommending slowing or stopping purchase of the U.S. government bonds. China's State Administration of Foreign Exchange called the report \"fake news.\"\nUltimately, however, some kind of tariff is the most likely Chinese action, according to Goldman Sachs economists Alec Phillips and Andrew Tilton. In a Jan. 26 report, they laid out five ways China could react to U.S. tariffs:\nTariffs or other import restrictions on U.S. goods or services to China , particularly for agriculture goods or transport equipment. T his is t he most likely course of action, the economists said. Regulatory or other unfavorable action against U.S. companies operating in China. Exchange rate depreciation, mitigating the negative effects of tariffs on China's exports. Sales of U.S. assets, such as U.S. Treasurys. A change in stance on North Korea or other geopolitical issues.

Bernstein\/File Photo The group on Monday was approaching the halfway point in its four-day, 50-mile (80-km) trek from the state capital of Madison to Janesville, Wisconsin in an event they were calling \u201cMarch for Our Lives: 50 Miles More.\u201d The event is billed as a continuation of the marches and demonstrations on Saturday that saw hundreds of thousands of teens take to the streets of Washington and other U.S. cities nationwide to call for stricter gun laws in the wake of last month\u2019s shooting at a Florida high school that left 17 dead. President Donald Trump on Friday signed a $1.3 trillion budget passed by the Republican-controlled Congress that included some tweaks to U.S. gun laws including modest improvements to background checks and grants to schools to prevent gun violence. The Wisconsin marchers on their website laid out additional demands for Ryan including that he back legislation that would ban military-style weapons for civilians, impose a national four-day waiting period on gun purchases and raise the minimum age to legally buy firearms to 21. A representative for Ryan did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Ryan, who was out of the country on Monday for the first day of an official visit to the Czech Republic, last month told a news conference that congressional Republicans were not interested in preventing Americans from owning certain types of weapons. \u201cWe shouldn\u2019t be banning guns from law-abiding citizens,\u201d Ryan said at the time. \u201cWe should be focusing on making sure that citizens who should not get guns in the first place don\u2019t get those guns.\u201d The students, who had marched more than 20 miles (32 km) by Monday, were spending nights on the road in schools, said Aileen Berquist, a spokeswoman for the Wisconsin march who also works for March On, a women-led political activist organization. They plan on arriving in Janesville by Wednesday, she said. Videos on Twitter showed the students marching and chanting: \u201cHashtag 50 more, that\u2019s what we\u2019re here for! We\u2019re walking 50 miles right up to your front door.\u201d Students from a high school outside Milwaukee thought up the march, with students from elsewhere around the state joining them, Berquist said.

It is used to determine the allocation to states of seats in the U.S. House of Representatives and to distribute billions of dollars in federal funds to local communities.\nRoss said in a memo that the Voting Rights Act requires a tally of citizens of voting age to protect minorities against discrimination, and that getting this information as part of the census would make it more complete.\nOpponents of a Census question about citizenship status say it could further discourage immigrants from participating in the count, especially when they are already fearful of how information could be used against them.\nThe State of California, which has a large immigrant population, responded early on Tuesday by filing a lawsuit in federal court against the commerce department and census bureau.\nCalifornia Attorney General Xavier Becerra asked the U.S. District Court in the Northern District of California to issue a preliminary injunction and rule that the move violates the constitution by interfering with the obligation to conduct a full count of the U.S. population.\nThe announcement came as President Donald Trump tries to keep his campaign promise to build a border wall between Mexico and the United States and to crack down on illegal immigration.\nHe ordered stricter immigration enforcement and banned travelers from several Muslim-majority countries soon after taking office in January 2017.\n\u201cThis untimely, unnecessary, and untested citizenship question will disrupt planning at a critical point, undermine years of painstaking preparation, and increase costs significantly, putting a successful, accurate count at risk,\u201d the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights said in a statement.\nU.S. Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross testifies to the House Appropriations Commerce, Justice, Science, and Related Agencies Subcommittee on the Commerce Department's FY2019 budget request on Capitol Hill in Washington, U.S., March 20, 2018.
